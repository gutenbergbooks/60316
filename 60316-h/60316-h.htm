The Romance which forms the staple of this
little volume is generally considered as belonging
to the <cite>Sindibād</cite> cycle of tales. It
has for ages been popular in the East, though to
the average English reader the very name of Prince
Bakhtyār is unknown. Many years ago the learned
Orientalist Sir W. Ouseley presented his countrymen
with an English translation of this romance,
but copies of his work have now become extremely
scarce.  Dr Johnson’s dictum, that the scarcity of
a book is evidence of its worthlessness, otherwise
copies of it would have been multiplied, is (like
not a few of his other tea-table sayings) more specious
than true. Many causes, besides that of uselessness,
may render a book scarce. A book may be a very
good book yet lack interest, excepting for only a few
readers; and such was doubtless the case of Sir W.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>Ouseley’s translation; for, strange to say, considering
our vast Asiatic possessions, the cultivation of Oriental
literature in this country has hitherto met with
little or no encouragement from the English people
generally.</p>

<p class='c009'>But among the more intelligent class of readers
there has lately sprung up considerable interest in the
curious migrations and transformations of popular
tales, the tracing of which from country to country,
and from modern to remote times, is not only a
fascinating, but a highly instructive pursuit; and
the idea occurred to me that a reprint of Sir W.
Ouseley’s translation of the Romance of Prince
Bakhtyār, together with explanatory and illustrative
notes, and—by way of introduction—such particulars
as could be ascertained regarding its origin and that
of similar Oriental fictions, might now find “readers
fit, though few.” My little project has been supported
by members of the Royal Asiatic Society and
the Folk-Lore Society. I have, moreover, been materially
assisted by several eminent scholars: amongst
others, by Mr William Platt, to whom I am indebted
for the substance of many of the Notes; and by Dr
R. Rost, who not only very kindly supplied me with
scarce and valuable books and manuscripts from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>India Office Library, but also furnished me with
much useful information on Eastern Fiction—a
subject upon which he is one of the highest authorities
in this country.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of the present collection of Tales it is remarked
by a learned and acute writer that they are, for the
most part, well wrought-out, probable, and without
anything magical or supernatural. And those readers
who do <em>not</em> delight in the extravagant creations of
Oriental fancy—enchanted groves and fairy palaces
beneath lakes, where carbuncles of immense size
supply the place of the sun—will find little in this
romance to shock their “common sense.” Nor are
there—except one or two expressions in the opening
passages—any of those hyperbolical descriptions of
female beauty and the puissance of monarchs which
are so characteristic of most of the fictions of the
East. These Tales are, indeed, singularly free from
such extravagancies, and may be considered as well
adapted to check the often fatal impetuosity of
Eastern monarchs, which was doubtless the purpose
of the original author.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Notes and Illustrations may seem disproportionate
in bulk to that of the text. They are, however,
designed, not only to explain and illustrate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>allusions to Oriental manners and customs, but also to
supply deficiencies of Sir W. Ouseley’s translation,
from a comparison of other Persian texts, and furnish
variants of the several tales as they are found in other
versions of the Romance. And while it is not
impossible that critics whose absurd shibboleth is
“originality” may be disposed to consider my little
book as “a thing of mere industry, without wit or
invention—a very toy,” yet I venture to think that
these Notes will prove to most readers not the least
interesting part of the work. In the Introduction
will be found some curious matter regarding this
romance and its congeners which has not before been
presented to English readers, the result of much
research; for, however defective my share of the
work may be, I have spared no pains to render it as
complete and accurate as I could: in short, I would
fain hope that, as a whole, the volume will be accepted
as a humble contribution to the still unwritten History
of Fiction; for even Dunlop’s meritorious work can
now only be regarded as a large contribution to this
“research of olde antiquitie.”</p>

The Persians, like all Eastern nations, remarks
Sir John Malcolm, “delight in Tales, Fables,
and Apothegms; the reason of which appears
obvious: for where liberty is unknown, and
where power in all its shapes is despotic, knowledge
must be veiled to be useful.” The ancient Persians
also had their Tales and Romances, the substance
of many of which is probably embodied in the celebrated
<cite>Shāh Nāma</cite>, or Book of Kings, of Firdausī.
And the fondness of the old pagan Arabs for the
same class of compositions seems to have threatened
the success of Muhammad’s great mission, to win
them back from their vain idolatry to the worship of
the <span class='fss'>ONE</span> God. For an Arabian merchant having
brought from Persia the marvellous stories of
Rustam, Isfendiar, Feridūn, Zohāk, and other famous
heroes, which he recited to the tribe of Kuraysh,
they were so delighted with them, that they plainly
told Muhammad that they much preferred hearing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>such stories to his legends and moral exhortations;
upon which the Prophet promulgated some new
passages of the Kur`ān (chapter xxx), in which the
merchant who had brought the idle tales and all who
listened to them were consigned to perdition. This
had the desired effect: the converts to Islām rejected
Tales and Poetry; and it was not until the
brilliant series of Muslim conquests in all parts of
the then known world were almost completed that
the Arabs began to turn their attention to literature
and science, and thus preserved to the world the
remains of the learning and philosophy of antiquity,
during the long period of intellectual darkness in
Europe. And it is remarkable that to a people
distinguished for nearly two centuries by their religious
bigotry and intolerance, and contempt for every
species of literature outside the Kur`ān, Commentaries,
and Traditions—that to the descendants of
the fanatical destroyers of the library at Alexandria
and of the literary treasures of ancient Persia are we
indebted for many of the pleasing fictions which have
long been popular in Europe. For, while India
seems to have been the cradle-land of those folk-tales,
yet they came to us chiefly through an Arabian
medium: brought to Europe, among other ways by the
Saracens who settled in Spain in the eighth century,
by crusaders and pilgrims returning from the Holy
Land, and also, perhaps, by Venetian merchants
trading in the Levant and the Muslim provinces of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>Northern Africa. However this may be, there can
be no doubt that, as Isaac D’Israeli remarks,
“tales have wings, whether they come from the
East or the North, and they soon become denizens
wherever they alight. Thus it has happened, that
the tale which charmed the wandering Arab in his
tent, or cheered the northern peasant by his winter’s
fireside, alike held on its journey towards England
and Scotland.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Many of the Fabliaux of the Trouvères of northern
France are evidently of Oriental origin; and their
prose imitators, the early Italian Novelists, also drew
much of their material—of course indirectly—from
similar sources. German folk-tales comprise variants
of the ever-charming Arabian story of `Alī Bābā and
the Forty Robbers, as in the tale of “The Dumberg,”<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c014'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
and of Aladdin (`Alā-`u-`d-Dīn) and the
Wonderful Lamp, as in the tale of “The Blue
Light.”<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c014'><sup>[2]</sup></a> Norse Tales, too, abound in parallels to
stories common to Arabia, Persia, and India. And
some of the incidents in one of them, “Big Peter
and Little Peter,”<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c014'><sup>[3]</sup></a> apparently find their origin in the
Hebrew Talmud. A very considerable proportion of
old European humorous stories ascribed to Arlotto,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi'>xvi</span>Tyl Eulenspiegel, Rabelais, Scogin (Andrew Borde),
Skelton, Mother Bunch, George Peele, Dick Tarlton,
etc., have somehow, and at some time or another,
winged their way from the Far East; since they are
found, with little modification save local colouring,
in very old Indian works. Galland, well-nigh two
hundred years ago, pointed out that the story of the
fellow in a tavern (according to our version, a blundering
Irishman in a coffee-house), who impudently
looked over a gentleman’s shoulder while he was
writing a letter, came from the East; and a version
of it is given in Gladwin’s <cite>Persian Moonshee</cite>. The
prototype of the popular Scottish song, “The Barrin’
o’ the Door,” is an Arabian anecdote. The
jest of the Irishman who dreamt that he was invited
to drink punch, but awoke before it was prepared,
is identical with a Chinese anecdote translated by
M. Stanislas Julien in vol. iv of the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal Asiatique</span></cite>,
and bears a close resemblance to one of the
Turkish jests ascribed to Khōja Nasru-`d-Dīn Efendī.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c014'><sup>[4]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvii'>xvii</span>Of stories of simpletons, such as the one last cited,
perhaps the largest and oldest collection extant is
contained in a section of that vast storehouse of
tales and apologues, aptly entitled, <cite>Kathá Sarit
Ságara</cite>, Ocean of the Rivers of Story, where may be
found parallels to the famous—the truly admirable!—exploits
of the <em>Wise</em> Men of Gotham, and to a similar
class of stories of fools and their follies referred to
in Mr Ralston’s <cite>Russian Folk-Tales</cite>. The story of
“The Elves and the Envious Neighbour,” in Mr
Mitford’s <cite>Tales of Old Japan</cite>, is practically identical
with a fairy tale of a hunchbacked minstrel in Mr
Thoms’ <cite>Lays and Legends of France</cite>. In the <cite>Arabian
Nights</cite> (Story of Abou Neeut and Abou Neeuteen, vol.
vi of Jonathan Scott’s edition) and in the Persian
romance of the Seven Faces (<cite>Heft Paykar</cite>), by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span>Nizāmī, the reader will find parallels to the “Three
Crows” in Grimm’s German popular tales. Our
favourite nursery story of Whittington and his Cat
(also common to the folk-tales of Scandinavia and
Russia, Italy and Spain) is related by the Persian
historian Wasāf in his “Events of Ages and Fates of
Cities,” written <span class='fss'><abbr title='Anno Hegirae'>A.H.</abbr></span> 699 (<span class='fss'><abbr title='Anno Dominem'>A.D.</abbr></span> 1299). The original
of the Goose that laid Eggs of Gold is a legend in the
great Indian epic, <cite>Mahábharata</cite>, and variants exist in
other Hindū works; but <em>this</em> may be a “primitive
myth,” common to the whole Aryan race. Largely,
indeed, are popular European tales indebted to
Eastern sources.</p>

<p class='c009'>For several centuries previous to the publication
of the first professed translation of a work of Eastern
fiction into a European language, there existed two
celebrated collections of Tales, written in Latin,
mainly derived from Oriental sources, to which may
be traced many of the popular fictions of Europe;
these are, the <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Clericali Disciplina</span></cite> of Peter Alfonsus,
a Spanish Jew, who was baptized in the twelfth
century; and the <cite>Gesta Romanorum</cite>, the authorship
of which is doubtful, but it is believed to have been
composed in the 14th century. The latter work
greatly influenced the compositions of the early
Italian Novelists, and its effect on English Poetry is
at least equally marked. It furnished to Gower and
Chaucer their history of <cite>Constance</cite>; to Shakspeare
his <cite>King Lear</cite>, and his <cite>Merchant of Venice</cite>, which is an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xix'>xix</span>Eastern story; to Parnell the subject of his <cite>Hermit</cite>—primarily
a Talmudic legend, afterwards adopted in
the Kur’ān. The <cite>Clericali Disciplina</cite>, professedly a
compilation from Eastern sources, contains a number
of stories of undoubted Indian origin, which
Alfonsus must have obtained through an Arabian
medium in Spain, however they may have come
thither. These fictions of Oriental birth were, of
course, filtered through the clerical mind of mediæval
Europe, and in the process they lost all their native
flavour. But on the publication of Galland’s <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les
Mille et Une Nuits</span></cite>, the Thousand and One Nights,
in the beginning of last century, garbled and Frenchified
as was his translation, the richness of the Eastern
fancy, as exhibited in these pleasing fictions, was at
once recognised, and, as the learned Baron de Sacy
has remarked, in the course of a few years this work
filled Europe with its fame. And its success has
continued to increase, so that there is perhaps no
work of fiction, whether native or exotic, which is at
the present day so universally popular throughout
Europe: it is at once the delight of the school-boy
and the recreation of the sage. Shortly after its
appearance in a French dress, Addison introduced it
to English readers in the <cite>Spectator</cite>, where he presented
a translation—or adaptation—of the now
famous story of Alnaschar (according to Galland’s
French transliteration of the name) and his basket of
brittle wares: a story which is not only calculated to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xx'>xx</span>please the “rising generation,” but may also instruct
“children of larger growth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When this work was first published in England
it seems to have made its way very rapidly into
public favour; and Weber, in his Introduction to
the <cite>Tales of the East</cite>, relates, as follows, a singular
instance of the effects they produced soon
after their first appearance: “Sir James Stewart,
Lord Advocate for Scotland, having one Saturday
evening found his daughters employed in reading the
volumes, he seized them, with a rebuke for spending
the evening before the Sabbath in such worldly
amusements; but the grave advocate himself became
a prey to the fascination of these tales, being found
on the morning of the Sabbath itself employed upon
their perusal, from which he had not risen during the
whole night!” The popularity of the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>
is due, no doubt, to the peculiar charm of its descriptions
of scenes and incidents which the reader is well
aware could only exist and occur in the imagination;
but we like to be taken away from our hard, matter-of-fact
surroundings—away into a world where, if we
cannot ourselves become endowed with supernatural
powers, at least we may summon mighty spirits to do
our will, to transport us whither we please, to bring
us in an instant the choicest fruits from the most
distant regions, to construct for us palaces of gold
and silver, and precious gems, to supply us with
dainties in dishes made of single diamonds and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxi'>xxi</span>rubies. In this very outraging of probability, and
even possibility, lies the strange fascination which
some of these Tales exercise over the reader’s mind.
He surrenders his judgment to the author, and such
is the force of the spell, that even when it has been
partly removed by closing the book, he will gravely
ask himself: “And why may not such things be?”
It has been justly observed by Lord Bacon, that, “as
the active world is inferior to the rational soul, so
Fiction gives to mankind what History denies, and
in some measure satisfies the mind with shadows
when it cannot enjoy the substance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This famous work is, of course, a compilation, and
not by a single hand and at one time, or from a particular
source, but from a variety of sources. Many
of the Tales are found in the oldest Indian collections;
probably the witty and humorous are purely
Arabian, while the tender and sentimental love-tales
are derived from the Persian. The origin of the
Arabian Tales has long been (and perhaps needlessly)
a vexed question among the learned. Baron
De Sacy has stoutly contended with M. Langles and
M. Von Hammer, on the questions of whether the
work was a mere translation or adaptation of an old
Persian collection, entitled the “Thousand Days,”
and when and where it was composed. But the
general opinion of scholars at the present day is that
the work was probably compiled by different hands,
in Egypt, about the 15th or 16th centuries, though it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxii'>xxii</span>is very probable that many additions were made at a
later date, by the insertion of romances, which formed
no part of the original collection, as we shall presently
see.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c014'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>A peculiarity of most collections of Eastern fictions
is their being enclosed within a frame, so to say, or
leading story; as in the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>: a plan
which appears to have been introduced into Europe
by a Latin translation of a romance of Indian origin,
known in this country by the title of <cite>The Seven
Sages</cite>, and which was first adopted by Boccaccio in
his celebrated <cite><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Decameron</span></cite>, where it is represented
that a party of ladies and gentlemen, during the
prevalence of the great plague in Florence, retire for
safety to a mansion at some distance from the city,
and there amuse themselves by relating stories. And
our English poet Chaucer, after the same fashion, in
his <cite>Canterbury Tales</cite>, represents a number of pilgrims,
of different classes, as bound for the shrine of
Thomas à Becket, and, to alleviate the tediousness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiii'>xxiii</span>of the journey, reciting stories of varied character. But
although this plan of making a number of stories all
subordinate to a leading story was introduced into
Europe in the 13th century, when the Latin version
of the “Seven Sages” was published, yet in the
East it had been in vogue many centuries previously.</p>

<p class='c009'>The oldest extant collection of Fables and Tales
(excepting the Buddhist Birth-Stories, recently made
known to English readers by Mr T. W. Rhys Davids’
translation of a portion) is that called in Europe <cite>The
Fables of Pilpay</cite>, or Bidpai, of which the Sanskrit
prototype is entitled <cite>Panchatantra</cite>, or Five Sections,
with its abridgment, <cite>Hitopadésa</cite>, or Friendly Instruction.
This work, or one very similar, existed in India
and in the Sanskrit language as early at least as the
6th century of our era, when it was translated into
Pahlavi, the ancient language of Persia, during the
reign of Nushīrvān, surnamed the Just (<span class='fss'><abbr title='Anno Dominem'>A.D.</abbr></span> 531–579).
This Pahlavi version—though no longer extant—escaped
the general wreck of Persian literature on
the conquest of the country by the Arabs, and was
translated, during the reign of the Khalīf Mansur
(<span class='fss'><abbr title='Anno Dominem'>A.D.</abbr></span> 753–774), into Arabic, from which several versions
were made in modern Persian, and also translations
into Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and most of the
European languages.  Perhaps no book of mere
human composition ever had such a remarkable literary
history and enduring popularity. These Fables,
although arranged in sections, are sphered one within
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiv'>xxiv</span>another in a rather bewildering manner, yet all are
subordinated to a leading story or general frame.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c014'><sup>[6]</sup></a>
It is worthy of note that, while there is no proof
that this work, in its present form, existed before the
sixth century, yet many, if not all, of the Fables
themselves have been discovered in Buddhistic works
which were certainly written about or before the
commencement of our era. Their translation from
the Pali, which the learned Benfey seems to have
conclusively proved, and their arrangement in the
form in which they exist in Sanskrit, may have been
done any time between the first and the sixth centuries.</p>

<p class='c009'>But there was another Indian work, now apparently
lost, formed on the same plan, which, if we may
credit El-Mas’ūdī, the Arabian historian, who lived in
the tenth century, certainly dates before our era;
namely, the <cite>Book of Sindibād</cite>, of which there have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxv'>xxv</span>been so many translations and imitations in Asiatic
and European languages, and to which the Persian
romance reproduced in the present volume is considered
to bear some relation. El-Mas’ūdi, in
his famous historical work, “Meadows of Gold
and Mines of Gems,” states very plainly that “in
the reign of Khūrūsh (Cyrus) lived Es-Sondbād,
who was the author of the Book of the Seven
Viziers, the Teacher, the Boy, and the Wife of the
King.” According to another Arabian writer, Sindibād
was an Indian philosopher who lived about a
hundred years B.C. El-Mas’ūdī does not mention
the version through which the work was known in
his time, but it was probably either in Arabic or
Persian. The oldest version known to exist is in
Hebrew, and is entitled <cite>Mishlī Sindabar</cite>, Parables
of Sindabar; the change of the name from Sindibād
to Sindibar, Deslongchamps conjectures to be a mistake
of the copyist, the Hebrew letters D and R
being very similar in form. This Hebrew version
has been proved to date as far back as the end of
the twelfth century. Under the title of <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Historia
Septem Sapientum Romæ</span></cite>, a Latin translation was
made—from the Hebrew, it is supposed—by Dam
Jehans, a monk of the abbey of Haute Selve, in the
diocese of Nancy, early in the 13th century. A
Greek version, entitled <cite>Syntipas</cite>, the date of which is
not known, was made by a Christian named Andreopulus,
who states in his prologue that he translated it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvi'>xxvi</span>from the Syriac. Notwithstanding this very distinct
statement, several learned scholars—Senglemann,
among others—have contended that the <cite>Syntipas</cite> was
made from the Hebrew version; of late years, however,
a unique but unfortunately mutilated manuscript
of the Syriac version, transcribed about the year
1560, was discovered by Rödiger, and reproduced in
his Syriac Chrestomathie, in 1868; and a year later
Baethgens published, at Leipsic, this text, together
with a German translation, under the title of <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Sindban,
oder die Sieben wiesen Meister</span></cite>, from which it appears
certain that the Greek version of Andreopulus was
made from the Syriac, the order of the stories being
the same in both. Besides the Hebrew and Syriac
versions of the <cite>Book of Sindibād</cite>, there exist translations
or adaptations in at least two other Oriental
languages, the Arabic and the Persian. The Arabian
version (to which perhaps El-Mas’ūdī alluded in his
mention of the work, as above) now forms one of the
romances comprised in the <cite>Book of the Thousand
Nights and One Night</cite> (the “Arabian Nights’ Entertainments”),
under the title of “The Story of the
King, his Son, his Concubine, and his Seven Viziers;”
and an English translation of it was published, in
1800, by Dr Jonathan Scott, in his <cite>Tales, Anecdotes,
and Letters, from the Arabic and Persian</cite>.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c014'><sup>[7]</sup></a>  Two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvii'>xxvii</span>poetical versions have been composed in Persian;
one of which, entitled <cite>Sindibād Nama</cite>,<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c014'><sup>[8]</sup></a> by Azraki,
who died, at Herat, <span class='fss'><abbr title='Anno Hegirae'>A.H.</abbr></span> 527 (<span class='fss'><abbr title='Anno Dominem'>A.D.</abbr></span> 1132–3), is mentioned
by Daulet-Shāh, in his life of Azraki, in these
terms: “And they say the Book of Sindibād, on
precepts of practical philosophy, is one of his compositions.”<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c014'><sup>[9]</sup></a>
The other Persian version is known in
Europe, I believe, only through Professor Forbes Falconer’s
excellent analysis<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c014'><sup>[10]</sup></a> of a unique manuscript, entitled
<cite>Sindibād Nāma</cite>, composed <span class='fss'><abbr title='Anno Hegirae'>A.H.</abbr></span> 776 (<span class='fss'><abbr title='Anno Dominem'>A.D.</abbr></span> 1374).</p>

<p class='c009'>It was through the Latin version, <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Historia Septem
Sapientum Romæ</span></cite>, that this very remarkable work
was communicated to nearly all the languages of
Western Europe; Herbers, or Hebers, an ecclesiastic
of the 13th century, made a translation, or rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxviii'>xxviii</span>imitation, of it in French verse, under the title of
<cite>Dolopatos</cite>. Many imitations in French prose subsequently
appeared, and from one of these the work
was rendered into English, under the title of <cite>The
Sevyn Sages</cite>, and <cite>The Seven Wise Masters</cite>, one of
which is among the reprints for the Percy Society,
and of the other Ellis gives an analysis, with specimens
in his <cite>Early English Metrical Romances</cite>. In
1516 an Italian version, entitled “The History of
Prince Erastus,” was published, which was afterwards
translated into French.</p>

<p class='c009'>In all these works, a young prince is falsely accused
by his step-mother of having attempted to violate her,
and the King, his father, condemns him to death, but
is induced to defer the execution of the sentence
from day to day, during seven days, by one of his
seven counsellors, viziers, or wise men, relating to the
King one or more stories, designed to caution him
against the wicked wiles of women; while the
Queen, every night, urges the King to put his son to
death, and, in her turn, tells him a story, intended to
show that men are faithless and treacherous, and that
fathers must not expect gratitude or consideration
from their sons. In the sequel, the innocence of the
Prince is established, and the wicked step-mother is
duly punished for her gross iniquity. This is the
leading story of most of the romances which have
been derived, or imitated, from the <cite>Book of Sindibād</cite>;
but the subordinate Tales vary materially in the
several translations or versions.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxix'>xxix</span>Dunlop, in his <cite>History of Fiction</cite>, remarks that
“the leading incident of a disappointed woman accusing
the object of her passion is as old as the story
of Joseph, and may thence be traced through the
fables of mythology to the Italian novelists.” But
surely there was nothing so very peculiar in the conduct
of Zulaykha (as Muslims name the wife of Potiphar)—nothing
very different from human (or woman)
nature in general, that should lead us to conclude,
with Dunlop, that all the numerous stories based upon
a similar incident had their common origin in the
celebrated tale of Joseph and Potiphar’s wife. We
have no reason to suppose a Hebrew origin for the
well-known classical legend of Phædra, who was
enamoured of Hippolytus, and, unable to suppress
her passion, made overtures to him, which were disdainfully
rejected; upon which Phædra accused Hippolytus
to her husband Theseus of attempting to dishonour
her. And although the work ascribed to the
Indian sage Sindibād now appears to be lost, yet this
“leading incident” of works of the Sindibād-cycle
forms the subject of several Indian romances, one of
which is a story in verse of a Prince named Sárangdhara,
whose step-mother Chitrángí falls in love with
him. He rejects her advances, on which she accuses
him to the King of attempting to violate her, and the
King orders him to have his feet cut off and to be
exposed to wild beasts in the forest. The innocence
of the Prince is afterwards proved, and the wicked
Queen is put to death.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxx'>xxx</span>There is yet another work usually considered as
belonging to the <cite>Sindibād</cite> class of romances, namely,
the Turkish Tales of the <cite>Forty Viziers</cite>, which is said
to have been composed, during the reign of Sultān
Murād II, in 1421, after an Arabian romance entitled
“Tales of the Forty Mornings and Forty Evenings,”
composed by Shaikh Zāda. But the author of this
work, as M. Deslongchamps has justly remarked, has
borrowed little from the <cite>Book of Sindibād</cite> besides the
frame. The tales—which are eighty in number, forty
of which are told by the Viziers, and forty by the
Queen—are quite different from, yet no whit inferior
to, those of any version of the King and his Seven
Counsellors. M. Petit de Lacroix, last century, made
a French translation of this work as far as the story of
the Tenth Vizier, which was soon afterwards rendered
into English, but divested of much of the Oriental
costume and colour.  In 1851 Behrnauer issued a
German rendering of the Turkish text.  And it
may interest some readers to know that Mr E. J.
W. Gibb—whose recently published translations of
Ottoman Poems, with Introduction, Biographical
Notices, and Notes, have received the approbation of
competent judges—is at present engaged on a complete
English translation of this highly entertaining
romance.</p>

Having in the preceding section glanced at
the various works of fiction in different
languages which have been derived or imitated
from the <cite>Book of Sindibād</cite>, let us now
proceed to examine the degree of relationship which
the <cite>Bakhtyār Nāma</cite> bears to the same work. The
learned writer of an able and interesting analysis, in
the <cite>Asiatic Journal</cite>, vol. xxx, 1839, of two different
manuscripts of the <cite>Thousand and One Nights</cite>, preserved
in the British Museum, has fallen into a
singular mistake when he says: “It is curious enough
that in each of the two MSS. a tale is interpolated on
the plan of the <cite>Bakhtyār Nāma</cite>. A King wishes to
destroy his son, and his Viziers relate stories to
prove the malice of women, alternately with the
King’s concubine, who has falsely accused the young
man, and who tells stories of the subtlety of men.”
This is the frame of the <cite>Sindibād Nāma</cite>, not that of
the <cite>Bakhtyār Nāma</cite>, since in the former the Viziers
are the defenders of the innocent, and relate stories
on his behalf; while the case is precisely reversed in
the <cite>Bakhytār Nāma</cite>, where the Viziers are the accusers,
eager for the death of the innocent young
man, and it is the accused youth himself who relates
the stories. The only resemblance which the Romance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxii'>xxxii</span>of Prince Bakhtyār bears to the leading story
of the <cite>Book of Sindibād</cite> (and its offspring) is the
incident of a youth being falsely accused of attempting
to violate the Queen, as will be seen from the
following outline of the Bakhtyār Story.</p>

<p class='c009'>A King, flying from his own kingdom, with his
Queen, is obliged to abandon in the desert a new-born
male infant, close to a well. This infant is discovered
by a band of robbers, the chief of whom,
struck with his beauty and the richness of his clothes,
carries him to his house, adopts him as his own son
and gives him an excellent education. At the age of
fifteen years the youth accompanies all the banditti
on a plundering expedition, in which they attack a
caravan, but are defeated, and many of their number,
including the adopted son of their chief, are taken
prisoners and brought before the King—the father of
the youth, who had in the meanwhile recovered his
kingdom. The young man’s grace and beauty so win
the King’s heart, that he not only pardons the whole
company, but takes the youth into his service, changing
his name from Khudādād (God-given) to Bakhtyār (Befriended
by Fortune). Bakhtyār acquits himself of his
new duties so well that the King promotes him to a
more important position—that of keeper of the royal
treasury, and his own intimate friend and counsellor.
These distinguished favours excite the envy of the
King’s Ten Viziers, who become eager for some opportunity
of bringing the favourite to disgrace and ruin.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxiii'>xxxiii</span>And it so chances, one evening, that Bakhtyār, being
muddled with wine, straggles into one of the chambers
of the harem, and throws himself upon the royal
couch, where he falls asleep. Shortly afterwards, the
King enters, and, discovering his favourite in the forbidden
part of the palace, his jealousy is aroused,
and he orders the attendants to seize the unhappy
young man, then sends for the Queen, and accuses
her of having introduced Bakhtyār into the harem.
The Queen protests that she is entirely innocent of the
charge, and at her suggestion the King causes them
both to be confined for that night in separate apartments,
resolving to investigate the affair in the morning.
Next day, the first of the Viziers, waiting on the King,
is informed of the supposed violation of the harem by
Bakhtyār, upon which the Vizier obtains leave to visit
the Queen, and ascertain from her the particulars of
the affair. The Queen, on being questioned by the
Vizier, denies all knowledge of Bakhtyār’s presence in
the King’s chamber (it does not appear, indeed, that
she had ever seen him before); but the Vizier assures
her that the King would not credit her assertion,
and counsels her, if she would save her own life, to
accuse Bakhtyār to the King of having presumed
to make dishonourable proposals to her, which she had,
of course, rejected with indignation. After much
persuasion, she at length consents, and accordingly
accuses the young man of this capital offence. The
King immediately commands Bakhtyār to be brought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxiv'>xxxiv</span>before him, and after bitterly reproaching him with
ingratitude for the many and unprecedented favours
which he had bestowed upon him, in the meantime
sends him back to prison. On the following day, the
second Vizier urges the King to put him to death; and
the King causes him to be brought into his presence,
and tells him that he must forfeit his life. Bakhtyār,
however, in eloquent terms, protests that he is perfectly
innocent of the crime of which he is accused, but expresses
his submission to the will of Providence, like a
certain unlucky merchant, with whom no affair prospered.
This arouses the King’s curiosity, and Bakhtyār
is permitted to relate the story, after which the
King sends him back to prison for that day. Every
morning of the eight following days one of the
Viziers, in turn, presents himself before the King, and
urges that Bakhtyār’s execution should be no longer
delayed; but when the youth is brought into the
King’s presence, as on the first day, he pleads his own
cause so well, and excites the King’s curiosity by
reference to some remarkable story, which he is allowed
to relate, that his execution is deferred from day to
day, until at length the King is reluctantly compelled
by the Viziers’ complaints to give orders for the public
execution of the young man. It happens, however,
that the robber-chief who had found the royal infant
at the well, and brought him up, is, with a party of his
men, among the crowd assembled round the scaffold,
and recognising in Bakhtyār his adopted son, rescues
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxv'>xxxv</span>him from the guard, and hastens to the palace, where,
obtaining audience of the King, the secret of Bakhtyār’s
birth is discovered; and the King resigns the
throne in favour of his son, and causes the Ten envious
Viziers to be put to death.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such is the frame within which nine different stories
are inserted; and although it was doubtless imitated
from, it has but a faint likeness to, that of the <cite>Book
of Sindibād</cite>. The work which appears most closely
to resemble the Romance of Prince Bakhtyār, in the
frame, is a collection of Tales in the Tamul language,
entitled, <cite>Alakeswara Kathá</cite>, in which four ministers
of the King of Alakapur are falsely accused of violating
the King’s private apartments, and vindicate their
innocence, and disarm the King’s wrath, by relating a
number of stories.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c014'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>According to M. Deslongchamps, in his learned and
elaborate <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Essai sur les Fables Indiennes</span></cite>, there exist in
Oriental languages three versions of the <cite>Bakhtyār
Nāma</cite>—Persian, Arabic, and Turkī (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i>, Eastern Turkish—Uygur).
Of the Persian version it is said there
are numerous manuscripts in the great libraries of
England and France; and besides the printed text
appended to Sir William Ouseley’s English translation,
published in 1800, a lithographed text was
issued, at Paris, in 1839, probably from a manuscript
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxvi'>xxxvi</span>in the Royal Library. The Arabian version, under
the title of “The History of the Ten Viziers,” forms
part of the text of the <cite>Thousand and One Nights</cite>, in
12 volumes, of which Dr Maximilian Habicht edited
vols. 1 to 8, published at uncertain intervals, at Breslau,
from 1825 to 1838 inclusive, when the work was
stopped by Habicht’s death. In 1842–3 Professor H.
L. Fleischer issued the remaining vols., 9 to 12. The
same year when Habicht began the publication of his
Arabian text he issued a complete German translation,
also at Breslau, in 15 small square volumes, under
the title of <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Tausend und Eine Nacht: Arabische
Erzählungen</span></cite>. <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zum erstenmal aus einer Tunesischen
Handschrift, ergänzt und vollständig übersetzt</span></cite>, von
Max. Habicht, F. H. Von der Hagen, und Karl
Schall.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c014'><sup>[12]</sup></a> But both the number and the order of the
tales of our romance are quite different in the translation
and the text: the sixth volume of the latter,
which contains the romance, was not published till
1834, or nine years after the first issue of the translation;
and it would seem that Habicht, in editing
his Tunisian manuscript, compared it with other texts,
and made very considerable changes. The romance
is found in a dislocated form in a work, published at
Paris in 1788, entitled, <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nouveaux Contes Arabice, ou
Supplement aux Mille et Une Nuits</span></cite>, &amp;c., par M.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxvii'>xxxvii</span>l’Abbè&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* In this book (which is of little or
no value) the several tales are not placed within the
frame, or leading story, which, however, appears in
connection with one of them. It is also included in
the French Continuation of the <cite>Thousand and One
Nights</cite>, translated by Dom Chavis and edited by M.
Cazotte,<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c014'><sup>[13]</sup></a> “but singularly disfigured,” says Deslongchamps,
“like the other Oriental Tales published by
Cazotte;” in Caussin de Perceval’s excellent edition
of the <cite>Nights</cite>, published, at Paris, in 1806, vol. viii,
and in Gauttier’s edition, vol. vi. The learned Swede
Gustav Knös published, at Gœtingen, in 1806, a dissertation
on the Romance of Prince Bakhtyār, and the
year following the Arabic text, with a Latin translation,
under the title of <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Historia Decem Vizirorum et filii
Regis Azād-bacht</span></cite>. He also issued a translation in the
Swedish language, at Upsal, in two parts, the second
of which appeared in 1814. Of the Turkī version M.
Amédée Jaubert has furnished, in the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal Asiatique</span></cite>,
Mars 1827, t. x, an interesting account, together with
a translation of one of the stories,<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c014'><sup>[14]</sup></a> from the unique
manuscript preserved in the Bodleian Library at Oxford,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxviii'>xxxviii</span>which he describes as very beautifully written,
the titles of the several tales and the names of the
principal characters being in red ink. Unfortunately
the manuscript is imperfect; at present it comprises
294 folia. M. Jaubert remarks that this Turkī version
is characterised by “great sobriety of ornament and
extreme simplicity of style, and the evident intention
on the part of the translator to suppress all that may
not have appeared to him sufficiently probable, and
all that might justly be taxed with exaggeration.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There is another Oriental rendering, of which M.
Deslongchamps was ignorant, in the language of the
Malays, with whom the romance is said to be a great
favourite, indeed they have at least two very different
versions of its frame, if not of the subordinate stories.
In Newbold’s work on Malacca,<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c014'><sup>[15]</sup></a> vol. ii, an outline is
given of the leading story, or frame, of one Malay
version, which exactly corresponds with that of the
Persian original, excepting that for Āzād-bakht we find
Zād-bokhtin, and that the minister’s daughter, who is
carried to the city by the King and in our version is
nameless, is called Mahrwat. I am indebted to the
courtesy of the learned Dr R. Rost, Librarian to the
India Office, for the following particulars regarding two
other Malay versions, from Van den Berg’s account of
Malay, Arabic, Javanese and other MSS., published at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxix'>xxxix</span>Batavia, 1877. One of these (p. <a href='#Page_21'>21</a>, No. 132) is entitled
“The History of Ghulām, son of Zād-bokhtān, King
of Adān, in Persia,” and the frame agrees with that of
our version, as already sketched in the present section,
excepting that the robber-chief who had brought up
Ghulām (our Bakhtyār),<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c014'><sup>[16]</sup></a> “learning that he had become
a person of consequence,” says Van den Berg,
“came to his residence to visit him, but finding him
imprisoned, he was much concerned, and asked the
King’s pardon on his behalf, telling him at the same
time how he had formerly found Ghulām in the
jungle; from which the King knew that Ghulām was
his son,” and so on. The other version (p. <a href='#Page_32'>32</a>, No.
179), though similar in title to the Persian original,
“History of Prince Bakhtyār,” differs very considerably
in the frame, which is thus analysed by Van den
Berg: “This Prince, when his father was put to flight
by a younger brother, who wished to dethrone him,
was born in a jungle and abandoned by his parents.
A merchant, Idrīs (Enoch), took charge of him and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xl'>xl</span>brought him up. Later on he became one of the
officers of state with his own father, who had in the
meanwhile found another kingdom, and decided with
fairness the cases laid before him. He was, however,
put in prison, on account of a supposed attempt upon
the King’s life, and he would have been put to death
had he not stayed the execution by telling various
beautiful stories. Even the King came repeatedly to
listen to him. At one of these visits Bakhtyār’s
foster-father Idrīs was likewise present, who related to
his adopted son how he had found him in the jungle.
The King, on hearing this, now perceived that it was
his son who had been brought up by Idrīs, recognised
Bakhtyār as such, and made over to him his kingdom.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So far as I am aware, there are but two translations
of the Persian version in European languages; one in
English, by Sir William Ouseley,<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c014'><sup>[17]</sup></a> which is reproduced
in the present volume; the other in French, by M.
Lescallier.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c014'><sup>[18]</sup></a> In his Preface, Sir William Ouseley
states that he selected for translation a text composed
in the least ornate style, and he seems to have contented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xli'>xli</span>himself with a rather free rendering (see prefatory
remarks, Notes and Illustrations, page <a href='#Page_121'>121</a> of the
present work). M. Lescallier takes care to inform his
reader that he adopted another plan: picking out
passages from two different manuscripts, and amalgamating
his selections into a work which, it is safe to
say, does not find its original in any single Persian
text extant: his object, indeed, seems to have been to
present an entertaining romance to French readers,
rather than to produce a translation of any particular
Persian original; and it must be admitted that
many of the lengthy conversations which occur in his
volume are quite as well omitted by Ouseley.</p>

<p class='c009'>The name of the author of this romance and the
precise time when it was composed are not known.
Ouseley states that none of the manuscripts of the
work which he had seen appeared to be much older
than the end of the 17th century. But we are now
able to place the date of its composition at least three
centuries earlier, since the manuscript of the Turkī
version, already referred to, bears to have been transcribed
<span class='fss'><abbr title='Anno Hegirae'>A.H.</abbr></span> 838, or <span class='fss'><abbr title='Anno Dominem'>A.D.</abbr></span> 1434; and it is not unlikely
that the translation was made several years before that
date. And as well-known or popular works are
usually selected for translation, we may reasonably
conclude that the Persian Romance of Prince Bakhtyār
was composed not later than the end of the 14th
century. That it is posterior to the end of the 13th
century might be supposed from the circumstance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xlii'>xlii</span>that the author in two instances<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c014'><sup>[19]</sup></a> employs maxims
which are found in the writings of the great Persian
poet Sa`dī, if we were sure that these maxims are really
Sa`dī’s own.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c014'><sup>[20]</sup></a> It has struck me as rather singular that
I can recognise only two of the nine stories which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xliii'>xliii</span>Bakhtyār relates as existing in another Eastern work,
namely, the <cite>Tūtī Nāma</cite>, or Tales of a Parrot, of Nakshabī.
This work, according to Pertsch, was written
in <span class='fss'><abbr title='Anno Dominem'>A.D.</abbr></span> 1330, and was preceded by another Persian
book on the same subject, by an unknown writer,
which was based on an older Sanskrit book (now lost),
of which the <cite>Suka Saptati</cite>, or Seventy Tales of a
Parrot, is only an abstract. Nakshabī’s work (adds
Pertsch), copies of which are rare, has been greatly
superseded by Kāderī’s abridgment, which was written
in India, probably about the middle of the 17th century.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c014'><sup>[21]</sup></a>
The “Story of the King of Abyssinia” (pp.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xliv'>xliv</span>74–85 of the present work) is identical with the story
told by the Parrot on the 50th Night in the <cite>Tūtī Nāma</cite>
of Nakshabī (India Office MS. 2573), where it bears
the title of “Story of the Daughter of the Kaisar of
Rūm, and her trouble by reason of her Son;” and
the “Story of the King of Abyssinia” (pp. <a href='#Page_62'>62</a>–72) corresponds
with the 51st Night, “Story of the Daughter
of the Vizier Khāssa, and how she found safety through
the blessing of her own purity” (for King Dādīn, and
his Viziers Kāmkār and Kārdār of our story, Nakshabī
has King Bahrām, and the Viziers Khāssa and
Khalāssa). Here the question naturally suggests
itself: did Nakshabī take these two stories from the
<cite>Bakhtyār Nāma</cite>, or did the author of the latter borrow
them from Nakshabī? It is at least a rather curious
coincidence that in the Persian romance of the “Four
Dervishes” (<cite>Chehār Darvīsh</cite>), ascribed to Amīr
Khusrū (about A.D. 1300), a work which is best known
by its Hindustanī version, <cite>Bāgh o Bāhar</cite>, or Garden
and Spring, occur the names of three of the persons
who figure in the Bakhtyār romance: the King, as in
our work, is called Āzādbakht, his son Bakhtyār, and
Bihzād is the name of a third.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lescallier, in the Preface to his translation, makes
a very extraordinary statement: he says that although
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xlv'>xlv</span>nothing is known regarding the authorship and date
of the romance, yet the work appears to be very ancient;
and remarks that there is nothing found in the
book to announce the institution of Muhammadanism—the
invocation of the Deity and salutation of the
Prophet, at the opening of the work, he thought likely
to be an interpolation of the copyists. Now the fact
is, that even in his own translation allusions to the
rites of Islām, if they are not of frequent occurrence,
are yet sufficiently numerous to prove beyond question
that the <cite>Bakhtyār Nāma</cite>, as it exists at present in
Persian, has been written, or modified, by a Muslim.
To cite a few instances: At page 17 of Lescallier’s
volume, we find the King, when he had abandoned
his child in the desert, represented as comparing his
condition to that of Jacob the Hebrew patriarch when
he believed that his son Joseph was dead. M. Lescallier
could never suppose that the romance was
written either by a Jew or a Christian; therefore this
passage clearly came from a Muslim pen. At page
27 mention is made of the “hour of mid-day prayer,”
one of the five times of obligatory prayer prescribed to
Muslims. At page 94 (p. <a href='#Page_52'>52</a> of the present volume)
the two sons of Abū Saber are represented as having
said to the merchant who purchased them of the
robbers: “We are free-born and Mussulmans.” At
page 140 (p. <a href='#Page_70'>70</a> of this work) the cameleer and the
lady reach the city “at the hour of evening prayer.”
Nevertheless M. Lescallier could not find anything in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xlvi'>xlvi</span>the work “qui annonce l’établissement du Mahométisme!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Since the Arabian version of the Romance of the
Ten Viziers given in the French Continuation of the
<cite>Thousand and One Nights</cite>, translated, as already
stated, by Dom Chavis and edited by M. Cazotte, is
not mentioned by M. Lescallier, we must conclude,
either that he did not know of it, or that he deemed
it beneath his notice. Dom Chavis and M. Cazotte
have, in truth, received rather hard treatment at the
hands of their critics. Dr Jonathan Scott, amongst
others, must gird at Cazotte, though without the
shadow of reason. In his edition of the <cite>Arabian
Nights</cite>, published in 1811,<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c014'><sup>[22]</sup></a> Appendix to vol. vi, referring
to the English translation of the “Continuation”
(see foot-note, page <a href='#Page_xxxvii'>xxxvii</a>), he says that
“the twelve first stories in the third volume had undoubtedly
an Oriental foundation: they exist, among
many others, in a Persian manuscript, lately in my
possession, entitled <cite>Jamī’u-’l-Hikāyāt</cite>, or a Collection
of Narratives. Sir William Ouseley has published a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xlvii'>xlvii</span>liberal<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c014'><sup>[23]</sup></a> translation of them, with the Persian text, by
reading which the liberties M. Cazotte has taken in
the tale of ‘Bohetzād and his Ten Viziers’ may be
fairly seen, and a reasonable conjecture formed of his
amplification of all others. Sir William Ouseley’s
hero is named Bakht-yār, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i>, Befriended by Destiny,
as in my manuscript, in that of M. Cazotte it is probably
Bakht-zād, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i>, Born under a Fortunate Planet.”
In this last sentence Scott has strangely blundered:
the <em>hero</em> of the Persian Tale is certainly called Bakhtyār,
but in Cazotte’s version it is the King who is
called Bohetzād (or Bakht-zād), and the hero, Aladdin.
From these strictures of his it is very obvious that
he was not aware of the existence of an Arabian version
of this romance. According to Lowndes’ <cite>Bibliographer’s
Manual</cite>, “a valuable edition of the Arabian
Nights was published, in 1798, by Richard Gough,
considerably enlarged, from the Paris edition, with
notes of illustration, and a preface, in which the supplementary
tales published by Dom Chavis are proved
to be a palpable forgery.” Gough’s name has not
come down to us in connection with the <cite>Arabian
Nights</cite>—except through Lowndes, where it is but a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xlviii'>xlviii</span>name. And Habicht’s Arabian text has very conclusively
disproved all Gough’s absurd “proofs;” and,
what is more, a comparison of the Romance as
given by M. Cazotte with Habicht’s text will not
only show that in both are the Tales of the same number
and placed in the same order, but the incidents
are almost invariably identical. The following is a
comparative table of the order of the Tales in the
“History of the Ten Viziers,” as they are found in
Habicht’s Arabian text, Cazotte, Caussin de Perceval,
the German translation, and the Persian version—of
the last the order and number of the tales are alike in
Ouseley, Lescallier, and the lithographed text:</p>

<p class='c009'>It will be observed from this table that in Habicht’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xlix'>xlix</span>Arabian text, in Cazotte, and C. de Perceval there are
eleven stories, including the Introductory Tale, which
forms part of the frame; and this arrangement is more
in accordance with what was evidently the original
plan of the romance than is our Persian version, in
which there is no story to counteract the arguments
employed by the First Vizier against Bakhtyār. In
all other romances of the Sindibād cycle, where the
sages, or counsellors, relate stories in behalf of the
accused, the narrators appear in regular succession,
from the first to the seventh (or, in the case of the
<cite>Forty Viziers</cite>, from the first to the fortieth); and there
can be little doubt, I think, that in the original Persian
romance—probably no longer extant—the First Vizier,
as in the Arabian version, was represented as appearing
before the King on the first day after Bakhtyār was
committed to prison, urging his immediate execution,
and the youth, on being brought into the King’s presence,
as relating one of the tales included in Habicht’s
text, but omitted in our present version. On
the Eleventh Day in Cazotte (reckoning the day of our
hero’s unhappy adventure as one) the young man relates
two stories, that of “Sulaymān Shāh and his
Family,” which exactly agrees with Habicht’s text; and
a rather pointless story, entitled “The King of Haram
and his Slave,” which is probably identical with the
eleventh tale in C. de Perceval, entitled “The Freed
Slave,” which takes the place of the story of Abū Temām,
omitted.  The titles of the several stories as given in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_l'>l</span>the above table are those in Habicht’s text. No. 3
in Cazotte is entitled “Ilage Mahomet and his Sons.”
No. 8 is “Baharkan, or the Intemperate (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i>, hasty-tempered)
Man”—our “King of Yemen” and in the
German translation “The Prince of Zanzībār.” No.
10 is in Cazotte also “Ibrahīm and his Son,” and the
incidents are the same in both. No. 7, “The History
of Bakht-zamān,” also in Cazotte and C. de Perceval,
but omitted in the Persian version, treats of the vain
attempts of a man to succeed in war or peace without
God’s help—utterly vain, unless prayers are offered up
for His assistance. No. 11 (our “King of Abyssinia”)
has the same title in Cazotte, and in both the story is
very differently told from the Persian narrative; it is,
however, an excellent tale, and I regret that I have not
space here for an analysis of it. In the German translation
our tenth story (“King of Persia”) is omitted,
although it is found in the Arabian text.</p>

<p class='c009'>To conclude: I am disposed to believe that the
Turkī translation was made from the Arabic, because
the story of “King Dādīn and his Two Viziers,” given
in pages <a href='#Page_189'>189</a>–194, corresponds with Habicht’s text and
with Cazotte’s translation, but varies materially from the
Persian text, in which the cameleer, who discovers the
pious daughter of the murdered Vizier, is represented
as being in the service of King Dādīn, who, when
informed of the lady’s wonderful sanctity, visits her at
the cameleer’s house and becomes reconciled to her;
while in the Turkī version, in Habicht’s text, and in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_li'>li</span>Cazotte (who probably knew nothing of the Turkī
translation) the cameleer is in the service of the King
of Persia, who visits the maiden, marries her, and
punishes King Dādīn and the wicked Vizier. If, then,
the Turkī version, which dates as far back as <span class='fss'><abbr title='Anno Dominem'>A.D.</abbr></span> 1434,
was made from the Arabic, and if the latter was translated,
or adapted, from the Persian, it is not unlikely
that the History of the Ten Viziers in its Arabian dress
existed some time before the <cite>Book of the Thousand
Nights and One Night</cite> was composed in its present
form; and therefore the Persian version may be, as
Lescallier conjectured, “very ancient.” And since
we have discovered that two of the stories exist in a
work which is of Sanskrit origin (see pp. <a href='#Page_xliii'>xliii</a> and <a href='#Page_xliv'>xliv</a>—and
in line 6 of the latter <em>for</em> “King of Abyssinia”
<em>read</em> “King Dādīn,”), we may go a step farther, and
suppose the other stories in the Romance of Bakhtyār
to have been also derived from Indian sources.</p>

<h4 class='c020'>HISTORY OF KING ĀZĀDBAKHT AND THE VIZIER’S DAUGHTER.</h4>

<div class='c021'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/i_003.jpg' width='100' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
Thus it is recorded by the authors of remarkable
histories, and the narrators of delightful tales,
that there was once in the country of Sīstān, a
certain King, possessing a crown and a throne, whose
name was Āzādbakht; and he had a Vizier entitled
Sipahsālār, a person of such bravery and skill that the
moon concealed herself among the clouds from fear
of his scimitar. This Vizier had a daughter endowed
with such exquisite beauty that the rose of the garden
and the moon of the heavenly spheres were confounded
at the superior lustre of her cheeks. Sipahsālār loved
this daughter with excessive fondness, so that he could
scarcely exist an hour without her. Having gone on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>an expedition to inspect the state of the country, it
happened that he found himself under a necessity of
passing some time from home. He immediately despatched
confidential persons with orders to bring his
daughter to him from the capital. These persons,
having arrived at the Vizier’s palace, paid their obeisance
to the damsel, who ordered her attendants to
prepare for the journey to her father. The horses
were instantly caparisoned, and a litter provided with
magnificence suitable to a princely traveller. The
damsel, seated in this, commenced her journey, and
went forth from the city.</p>

<p class='c009'>It happened that the King, who had gone on a
hunting-party, was at that moment returning from the
chase. He beheld the litter with its ornaments and
splendid decorations; and, whilst he gazed, it was
borne quite out of the town. He sent to inquire
about it; and the attendants said that it belonged to
the daughter of Sipahsālār, who was going to her
father. When the King’s servants returned and
reported to him this intelligence, he rode up to the
litter that he might send his compliments to Sipahsālār.
On his approach the attendants alighted from their
horses, and kissed the ground of respectful obedience.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>The King, having desired that they would bear his
salutations to the Vizier, and they having promised
punctually to do so, was preparing to turn back,
when suddenly, the wind lifting up a corner of the
hangings which covered the litter, his eyes were fixed
by the fascinating beauty of the damsel; and he who in
the chase had sought for game became now the captive
prey of this lovely maid, and fell into the snares of
love. At length he ordered the attendants to despatch
a messenger to the north, where Sipahsālār
was, and to inform him that the King would accept
his daughter as a wife, hoping that he might not be
esteemed an unworthy son-in-law.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the attendants heard this, they kissed the
ground of obedience, saying: “Long be the King’s
life!—the sovereign of the earth and of the age, and
the ruler of the world! If Sipahsālār could even
dream of this honour, he would be supreme in
happiness. But, if the King permit, we will proceed
with the damsel to her father, and inform him of what
has happened, that he may prepare everything necessary
for the occasion, and then send her back to the
city.” When the servant of the damsel had thus
spoken, the King, who was displeased with his discourse,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>exclaimed: “How darest thou presume to
counsel or advise me?” He would have punished
the servant on the spot, but he feared lest the tender
heart of his fair mistress should be distressed thereby.
He accordingly remitted the punishment; and taking
the reins into his own hands, he conducted the litter
back towards the city, which he entered at the time
when the shades of evening began to fall.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next day he assembled the magistrates and
chief men; and, having asked the damsel’s consent
to the marriage, he caused the necessary ceremonies
to be performed. The secretaries were employed in
writing letters of congratulation; and Sipahsālār was
informed of the insult offered to him during his
absence, which caused the tears to flow from his eyes
whilst he perused the letters of congratulation. He
dissembled, however; and, concealing his vexation,
wrote letters to the King, and addressed him in language
of the strongest gratitude, declaring himself at a
loss for words whereby to express his sense of the
honour conferred upon him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such was the purport of his letters; but in his
mind he cherished hopes of revenge, and day and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>night were employed in devising stratagems by means
of which he might obtain it.</p>

<p class='c009'>After two or three months spent in this manner,
Sipahsālār assembled all the chief officers of the army,
and informed them that, confiding in their secrecy
and fidelity, he would communicate to them an affair
of considerable importance. They all assured him of
their attachment and regard; and declared that the
flourishing state of the empire was the result of his
wisdom, prudent management, and bravery. To this
Sipahsālār replied: “You all know what actions I
have performed, and what troubles I have undergone,
to raise the empire to its present state of glory and
prosperity: but what has been my recompense?
You have seen how the ungrateful monarch carried
off my daughter.” Having thus spoken, a shower of
tears fell from his eyes; and the chiefs who were
assembled about him said: “We have been acquainted
with this matter for some time, and it has
given us great concern. But now the moment is
arrived when we may depose this king.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Sipahsālār threw open the doors of his treasury,
and distributed considerable sums of money amongst
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>the soldiers; so that in a little time he assembled a
multitude of troops, almost innumerable. He then
resolved to attack the King, and, with that intention,
seized, during the night, upon all the avenues of the
city, both on the right hand and on the left.</p>

<p class='c009'>The King, astonished and alarmed at the tumult,
consulted with the Queen, saying: “What can we do
in this misfortune? For it is a night to which no
morning shall succeed, and a war in which there is
not any hope of peace.”—The Queen replied: “Our
only remedy for this evil is to fly and seek protection
in the dominions of some other prince, and
solicit his assistance.”—Āzādbakht approved of this
counsel, and resolved to seek an asylum from the
King of Kirmān, who was renowned for his generosity
throughout the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the palace there was a certain door which opened
into a subterraneous passage leading towards the desert.
The King gave orders that two horses should be instantly
saddled; and having put on his armour, and
taken from the royal treasury many precious jewels
and fastened them in his girdle, he placed the Queen
on one of the horses, and mounting the other himself,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>they went forth privately through the door above-mentioned,
and directed their course towards the
desert.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now it happened that the Queen had been for
nine months in a state of pregnancy; and, after travelling
during a whole day and night in the desert, they
arrived at the side of a well, whose waters were more
bitter than poison, and unpleasant as the revolutions
of inconstant Fortune. Here the Queen was affected
by the pains of labour; whilst heat and thirst reduced
both the King and her to despair: their mouths were
parched up for want of water, and they had no hopes
of saving their lives; for the sword of the enemy
was behind them, and before them the sand of the
desert. In this forlorn situation the Queen said:
“As it is impossible for me to proceed any farther, I
entreat you to save your own life, and find out some
place where water may be obtained. Though I must
perish here, you may be saved; and a hundred
thousand lives such as mine are not in value equal to
a single hair of the King’s head.”—Āzādbakht replied:
“Soul of the world! I can relinquish riches and
resign a throne; but it is impossible to abandon my
beloved: her who is dearer to me than existence itself.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Thus were they engaged in conversation, when
suddenly the Queen brought forth a son; in beauty
he was lovely as the moon, and from the lustre of his
eyes the dreary desert was illumined. The Queen,
pressing the infant to her bosom, began to perform
the duties of a mother, when the King told her that
she must not fix her affections on the child, as it
would be impossible to take him with them: “We
must, therefore,” added the King, “leave the infant
on the brink of this well, and commit him to the
providence of the Almighty, whose infinite kindness
will save him from destruction.”—They accordingly
wrapped up the child in a cloak embroidered with gold
and fastened a bracelet of ten large pearls round his
shoulders; then, leaving him on the brink of the well,
they both proceeded on their journey to Kirmān,
whilst their hearts were afflicted with anguish on
account of their helpless infant. When they approached
the capital of Kirmān, the King of that
place was informed of their arrival. He sent his
servants to welcome them, and received them with
the greatest respect and hospitality; he provided a
princely banquet, and assembled all the minstrels, and
sent his own son and two attendants to wait on Āzādbakht.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>During the feast, whilst the musicians were employed
in singing and playing, and the guests in
drinking, whenever the wine came round to Āzādbakht,
his eyes were filled with tears. The King of
Kirmān, perceiving this, desired him to banish sorrow,
and to entertain a hope that Heaven might yet be
propitious to him. Āzādbakht replied: “O King of
the world! how can I be cheerful, whilst thus an
exile from my home, and whilst my kingdom and my
treasures are in the possession of my enemies?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The King of Kirmān then inquired into the particulars
of Āzādbakht’s misfortunes, which he related
from beginning to end. The heart of the King of
Kirmān was moved with compassion; and during
that whole day he endeavoured, by every sort of
amusement, to divert the mind of his guest from
dwelling on the past misfortunes. The next day he
ordered a powerful army to be led forth, and placed
it under the command of Āzādbakht, who marched
immediately towards the capital of his own dominions.
On the King’s approach, Sipahsālār, who had usurped
his authority, fled in confusion, and all the troops,
the peasants, and other inhabitants paid homage to
Āzādbakht, and entreated his forgiveness. He pardoned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>them; and again ascending the royal throne,
governed his people with justice and generosity;
and having liberally rewarded the King of Kirmān’s
soldiers, he sent them back with many rare and
valuable presents for that monarch.</p>

<p class='c009'>After these transactions, Āzādbakht and his Queen
passed their time in a state of tranquillity, interrupted
only by the remembrance of the child whom they had
left in the desert, and whom, they were persuaded,
wild beasts must have devoured the same hour in
which they abandoned him: but they little knew the
kindness which Providence had shown him.</p>

<p class='c009'>It happened that the desert in which they had left
the infant was frequented by a gang of robbers, the
chief of whom was named Farrukhsuwār; and very
soon after the King and Queen had departed, these
robbers came to the well; there they discovered a
beautiful infant crying bitterly. Farrukhsuwār alighted
from his horse and took up the child; and his extraordinary
beauty induced them to believe him the son
of some prince or illustrious personage. In this
opinion they were confirmed by the ten valuable
pearls which were fastened on his shoulders. As
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Farrukhsuwār had not any child, he resolved to adopt
this infant as his own, and accordingly bestowed on
him the name of Khudādād; and having taken him
to his home, committed him to the care of a nurse.
When he was of a proper age, Farrukhsuwār instructed
him in all necessary accomplishments, and in horsemanship
and the use of arms, which rendered him,
with his natural bravery, when fifteen years of age,
able to fight, alone, five hundred men. Farrukhsuwār
loved this youth with such affection that he
could not exist one moment without him, and took
him along with him wheresoever he went. Whenever
it happened that the robbers were proceeding
to attack a caravan, Khudādād, who felt compassion
for the merchants and travellers, and at all times disliked
the profession of a robber, requested that Farrukhsuwār
might dispense with his attendance, and leave
him to guard the castle. Farrukhsuwār consented
that he should not join in attacking the caravan; but
entreated him to accompany the robbers to the scene
of action. It happened, however, one day, that they
attacked a caravan consisting of superior numbers,
and of such brave men that they fought against the
robbers with success, and took several of them prisoners.
In this action Farrukhsuwār received a wound,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>and was near falling into the hands of his enemies,
when Khudādād, mounting his charger, galloped into
the midst of the battle, and put many of them to
death.</p>

<p class='c009'>But it was so ordained that he should fall from his
horse; in consequence of which, he was taken prisoner,
and with many of the robbers, led in chains to the
capital.</p>

<p class='c009'>The chief of the caravan having brought them all
before the tribunal of Āzādbakht, the King’s eyes were
no sooner fixed upon the countenance of Khudādād,
than paternal affection began to stir his heart: he
wept, and said: “Alas! if the infant whom I abandoned
in the desert were now alive, he would probably
appear such a youth as this!” He continued to gaze
involuntarily upon him, and, desiring him to approach,
inquired his name, and said: “Art thou not ashamed
to have abused the favours of Heaven, which has
endowed thee with so much beauty and strength, by
plundering travellers, and seizing on the property to
which thou hadst not any right?”—Khudādād, with
tears, replied: “The Lord knows my innocence, and
that I have never partaken of the plunder.”—Āzādbakht
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>then granted him a free pardon, and took him
into his service, desiring that his chains might be
taken off; he also put on him his own robe, and
said: “I now give you the name of Bakhtyār; from
this time forth Fortune shall be your friend.”<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c014'><sup>[25]</sup></a> The
King then dismissed the other robbers; to whom, on
condition that they would never again commit any
depredations, he granted not only their lives, but a
pension, by which he engaged them in his service.</p>

<p class='c009'>After this Bakhtyār continued day and night in
attendance on the King, whose affection for him
hourly increased. To his care were entrusted the royal
stables, which he superintended with such skill and
good management that in a few months the horses became
fat and sleek; and the King, one day remarking
their improved condition, understood that it was the
result of Bakhtyār’s care and attention, and conceiving
that a person who evinced such abilities was capable of
managing more important matters, he sent for Bakhtyār,
at his return to the palace, and ordered that the
keys of the treasury should be presented to him, and
thus constituted him keeper of the treasures. Bakhtyār,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>having kissed the ground, was invested with a
splendid robe of honour. He discharged the duties
of his high station with such fidelity and attention
that he every day increased in favour with the King,
and at length was consulted on every measure, and
entrusted with every secret of his royal master. If
on any day it happened that Bakhtyār absented himself
from the palace, on that day the King would not
give audience to any person: and the advice of
Bakhtyār was followed on every occasion of importance.
In short, he was next in power to the King,
and his conduct was discreet and skilful.</p>

<p class='c009'>But there were Ten Viziers, who became envious of
his exaltation, and conspired against him, resolving to
devise some stratagem whereby they might deprive
him of the King’s esteem, and effect his degradation.</p>

<p class='c009'>It happened one day that Bakhtyār, having indulged
in the pleasures of wine beyond the bounds of moderation,
lost the power of his reason, and continued in a
state of sleepy intoxication until night came on and
the world became dark; the porters fastened the gates,
and the sentinels repaired to their respective stations.
Bakhtyār, after some time, came forth from the treasury,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>but knew not whither he went, so completely had
the wine deprived him of recollection: he wandered
on, however, until he found himself in one of the
King’s private apartments, where he saw tapers burning,
a couch with pillows and cushions, a splendid
throne, or seat, and various embroidered robes and
silken coverings. This was the apartment in which
the King used to sleep. Here, from excessive intoxication,
Bakhtyār flung himself upon the throne:
after a little while the King entered, and discovering
the unfortunate young man, inquired, with violent
anger, his business in that place. Bakhtyār, roused
by the noise, threw himself from the throne, and
crept beneath it, where again he fell asleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>The King, having called some attendants, ordered
them to seize him, and, drawing his sword, hastened
to the Queen, of whom he asked how Bakhtyār found
admittance to the private apartments of the palace;
and added, that he could not have come there without
her knowledge. The Queen, shocked at such an
imputation, declared herself ignorant of the whole
transaction but desired the King, if he still entertained
any suspicions, to confine her that night, and
inquire into the matter on the next morning, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>her innocence would appear, and the guilty might
be punished. The King accordingly ordered her to be
confined, and suspended the execution of vengeance
during that night.</p>

<p class='c009'>When morning came, being seated on the royal
throne, he gave audience to his ten Viziers. The first
of these, having paid his respects to the King, inquired
into the transactions of the preceding night, and was
informed of all that had occurred. The enmity which
this Vizier had long cherished in his heart against
Bakhtyār induced him to conceive that a fair opportunity
now offered of destroying that unfortunate
young man; and he said within himself: “Though
he may have a thousand lives, he shall not be able to
save one of them.” He then addressed the King, and
said: “How could a person bred up in the desert, and
by profession a robber and assassin, be fit for the service
of a King? I well knew that his wickedness would
appear, but durst not say so; now, however, that it
is manifest, let the King ordain for him such a punishment
as may be a lesson to all the world.”—The King
gave orders that Bakhtyār should be brought before
him. “Ungrateful wretch!” said he, “I forgave your
offences; I spared your life; I raised you to dignities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>almost equal to my own; and you requite these
favours by treason and perfidy: you have entered
into the recesses of my harem, and have presumed to
occupy my place.”—Bakhtyār on hearing this began
to weep; declared himself ignorant of all those transactions,
and that if he had been found in the royal apartments,
he must have wandered there unconsciously.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first Vizier solicited the King’s permission that
he might go to the harem, and inquire from the
Queen all that she knew concerning this affair.
Having obtained permission, he went to the Queen,
and told her, that there were various reports on the
subject of that young robber Bakhtyār, in which she
was implicated; that, as the King was exceedingly
enraged against her, the only means whereby she
could appease his anger would be to accuse Bakhtyār,
and to say,—“O King! thou hast brought hither
the son of a robber; thou hast bestowed on him the
name of ‘Fortune’s Favourite,’ and hast exalted him
to honours; but his baseness has at length appeared:
he has presumed to make amorous proposals to me,
and has threatened, should I not comply with his
licentious desires, to use violence with me, to kill the
King, and to seize upon the throne.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>“This declaration,” said the Vizier to the Queen,
“will induce the King to order the immediate execution
of Bakhtyār, and you will at the same time reestablish
yourself in his good opinion.”—The Queen
was astonished, and replied: “How can I, even to
save myself, thus destroy the life of an innocent person
by a false testimony?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The life of Bakhtyār,” said the Vizier, “has long
been forfeited to the laws, since he exercised the profession
of a robber and a murderer; therefore, any
scruples on that subject are vain; and I’ll answer at
the day of judgment for your share in this transaction.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Queen at last consented to follow the Vizier’s
advice; and he returned to the presence of the King,
who desired to know the result of his conference with
the Queen. The artful Vizier replied: “That which
I have heard, I have not the power of relating; but
the Queen herself will tell it.” The King, having
retired, sent for the Queen, and she repeated to him
all that the Vizier had instructed her to say. The King,
acknowledging that he was himself to blame, as having
bestowed favours on the base-born son of a robber,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>gave orders that heavy irons should be put on the feet
of Bakhtyār, and sent him to prison; declaring that in
due time he should suffer such a punishment as would
strike terror into all men.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the meantime, Bakhtyār languished in the prison,
appealing to God for relief; and the Viziers returned
to their homes, devising means whereby they might
induce the King to hasten the execution of the young
man.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
On the following day the second Vizier came before
the King, and, having paid his respects, recommended
that Bakhtyār should be no longer kept
in prison, but led out to execution. The King approved
of this advice, and gave orders that Bakhtyār and the
executioner should be brought before him. When
they were come, he addressed the young man, and
told him that he had directed the tree of his existence
to be rooted out from the soil of his empire. Bakhtyār
replied: “Long be the King’s life! Such is my
prayer, as I stand here on the eve of departure from
this world; yet, as it is every man’s duty to endeavour
by honest means to save himself, I appeal to the
Almighty, who knows my innocence. But alas! my
situation is like that of the Merchant, whom good
fortune constantly avoided, and evil fortune incessantly
pursued, so that all his exertions ended in disappointment,
and all his projects failed of success.”—The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>King desired to hear the story of this ill-fated Merchant,
and Bakhtyār, after the usual compliments,
began to relate it as follows:</p>

<h4 class='c020'>STORY OF THE ILL-FATED MERCHANT, AND HIS ADVENTURES.</h4>

<p class='c021'>In the city of Basra there was a certain man, a
merchant, who possessed immense riches; but it was
decreed that the light of prosperity should be changed
into the darkness of misfortune, so that in a short
space of time very little of all his wealth remained,
and whatsoever commercial projects he tried invariably
terminated in loss.</p>

<p class='c009'>It happened one year, that the price of corn was
increased, and the Merchant thought that, by laying
out what remained of his money in purchasing some
loads of corn and keeping it till the next year, he might
profit considerably. He therefore hired a granary,
purchased some corn, and laid it by, in expectation
that the price would rise.</p>

<p class='c009'>But corn became more abundant, and consequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>more cheap, the following season. When the Merchant
perceived this, he resolved to keep that which
he had in store until the next year, thinking it probable
that a barren season might succeed a plentiful
one. But it happened that the next year, so much rain
fell, that most of the houses were washed away, and
the water found its way into the Merchant’s granary,
where it spoiled all his corn, and caused it to send
forth a smell so intolerable, that the people of the city
compelled him to throw it away.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was confounded by this misfortune; but after
some time, finding that he could not derive any profit
from idleness or inactivity, he sold his house, and
joined a company of merchants, who were setting out
on a voyage by sea. With them, he embarked on
board a vessel, and after three days and three nights,
the world became dark, the tempest arose, the billows
rolled: at length the ship was wrecked, and many of
the crew perished. The Merchant, with a few others,
was saved on a plank, and cast on dry land.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hungry and naked, he wandered into a desert, when,
after advancing some leagues, he discovered a man at
a little distance. Delighted to find that the country
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>was inhabited, and hoping to be relieved from hunger
and thirst, which had now become almost insupportable,
he directed his course towards that man, and
soon perceived an extensive and populous village,
with trees and running streams. At the entrance to
this village he stopped. The chief man, or <em>dihkān</em>, of
the place was a person of considerable wealth, and
of great generosity; he had erected in the outlets of
this village, a summer-house, in which he happened
to be when the Merchant arrived. As soon as he
discovered the stranger, he ordered his servants to
bring him into the summer-house. The stranger
paid his respects, and was entertained by the dihkān
with politeness and hospitality. Having satisfied his
hunger and thirst, he related, at the desire of his host,
all the circumstances of his past life, and all the
misfortunes he had undergone. The story excited
compassion in the breast of the generous dihkān, who
gave the Merchant a suit of his own clothes, and
bade him not despair, for he would keep him with
himself until his affairs should be again in a prosperous
condition.</p>

<p class='c009'>After this, the dihkān gave into the Merchant’s
charge the account of his property and possessions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>and said that he would allow him, for his own share,
the eleventh part of all the corn. The Merchant,
much delighted, was very diligent in superintending
the concerns of his employer; and as the harvest
proved very abundant, when the corn was gathered in,
he found his portion so considerable, that he said
within himself: “The dihkān most probably will not
consent to allow me such a share; I shall therefore
take it and conceal it, until the settlement of accounts,
when, if he think proper to bestow so much on me,
I shall give back this.” He accordingly took this
quantity of the corn, and concealed it in a cavern;
but it happened that a thief discovered what he had
done, and stole the corn away by night.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the dihkān inspected the accounts of the
harvest, and had made his calculation of the produce,
he assigned to the Merchant the eleventh part of the
corn. The Merchant returned him thanks, and acknowledged
the doubts which he had entertained, and
told him how he had set apart a certain portion of the
corn, “which,” said he, “I shall now go and cause to
be deposited in the granary.” The dihkān sent two
of his people with him to the place where he had
concealed the corn, but none could be found. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>were astonished, and bit the finger of amazement.
When the dihkān was informed of this circumstance,
he became angry, and ordered that the Merchant
should be driven forth out of the village.</p>

<p class='c009'>In melancholy plight, the unlucky Merchant turned
his face towards the road which led to the sea-shore.
There he chanced to meet six of those persons who
gain a livelihood by diving for pearls. They knew
him, and inquired into his situation. He related to
them all that had happened, and his story so much
excited their compassion that they agreed to bestow
on him, for the sake of God, whatsoever their next
descent to the bottom of the sea should produce. They
accordingly, with this charitable intention, plunged all
six into the sea, and each brought up from the bottom
a pearl of such exquisite beauty that its equal could
not be found amongst the treasures of any monarch.
The Merchant received from the divers those six precious
pearls, and set forward with a joyful heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>It happened that after some time he fell into company
with certain robbers, whom he much feared, and
he resolved to save part, at least, of his property, by
concealing three of the pearls in his mouth, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>other three among his clothes; hoping that, if they
should search him, they might be contented with these,
and that he might save those concealed within his
mouth. He accordingly put three of the pearls among
his clothes, and the other three into his mouth, and went
on for some time without exciting any suspicion, or
attracting the notice of the robbers. But unluckily
opening his mouth to address them, the pearls fell on
the ground; and when the robbers saw them, they
seized the Merchant, and so terrified him with their
threats and violence that he became senseless. The
robbers, perceiving this, took up the three pearls and
went away. After some time the Merchant recovered
his senses, and was overjoyed to find that he had still
three of the pearls left.</p>

<p class='c009'>Proceeding on his journey, he arrived by night at
a certain city, where he slept; and next morning went
to the shop of a jeweller, to whom he offered the pearls
for sale. The jeweller, on beholding them, was astonished;
for they far exceeded anything he had ever
seen: then casting his eyes on the mean and squalid
garments of the Merchant, he immediately seized him
by the collar, and exclaimed with a loud voice, accusing
the unfortunate stranger of having stolen the pearls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>from his shop: a violent struggle and dispute ensued,
and at length they both proceeded to the tribunal of
the King.</p>

<p class='c009'>The jeweller was a man of some repute in the city,
and that which he said was believed by the inhabitants.
He accused the Merchant of having contrived a hole
through which he stole away a casket of gold and
jewels from his shop, and those three pearls were
part of the contents of the casket. The Merchant
declared himself innocent; but the King ordered him
to deliver the pearls to the jeweller, and he was loaded
with chains and thrown into prison.</p>

<p class='c009'>There he pined in misery and affliction, until after
some time those divers who had given him the pearls
arrived in that city; and going to visit the prison, that
they might benefit by seeing the punishment of vice
and wickedness, they distributed some money among
those who were confined, and at last discovered the
Merchant in a corner, loaded with chains. They were
astonished, and inquired into the occasion of his disgrace.
He related the whole affair, and they, feeling
great indignation on account of the injurious treatment
which their friend had suffered, desired him not to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>despair, as they would soon procure him his liberty.
They immediately hastened from the prison to the palace.
The chief of them was a man whom the King
much respected; and when he had related the
story of the Merchant, and of the pearls which they
had given him, the King became convinced of the
jeweller’s guilt, and instantly ordered him to be seized
and brought before him, and at the same time that the
Merchant should be released from prison. When
the jeweller appeared before the King, his confusion
and trembling betrayed his guilt. The King asked him
why he had thus injured a stranger; but he remained
silent; and was then led away to execution. The
King caused to be proclaimed throughout the city:
“Such is to be the punishment of those who shall
injure or do wrong to strangers.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He directed also, that the property of the jeweller
should be transferred to the Merchant. Supposing
that a man who had seen so much of the world, both
of prosperity and adversity, must be well qualified for
the service of a King, he ordered a splendid robe to be
given to the Merchant; and desired that he should
be purified from the filth of a prison in a warm bath,
and appointed him keeper of the treasury.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>The Merchant employed himself diligently in the
duties of his station; but there was a vizier who
became envious of his good fortune, and resolved to
devise some stratagem whereby to effect his ruin.</p>

<p class='c009'>The King’s daughter had a summer-house adjoining
the treasury, and it was her custom to visit this
summer-house during six months of the year, once
every month. It happened that a mouse had made
a hole quite through the wall of the treasury; and
one day the Merchant having reason to drive a nail
into the wall, it entered into the hole which the mouse
had made, and went through and caused a brick to
fall out on the road which led to the Princess’s
summer-house. The Merchant went immediately and
stopped up the hole with clay.</p>

<p class='c009'>The malicious vizier, having discovered this circumstance,
hastened to the King, and informed him
that he had seen the Merchant making a hole through
the wall of the summer-house, and that, when he had
found himself detected, he had, in shame and confusion,
stopped it up with clay. The King was
astonished at this information: he arose and proceeded
to the treasury, where finding the Merchant’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>hands yet dirty from the clay, he believed what the
vizier had told him; and on returning to his palace,
ordered his attendants to put out the Merchant’s eyes,
and to turn him out at the palace-gate. After this the
King went to the summer-house, that he might pay a
visit to his daughter; but he found that she had not
been there for some time, having gone to amuse herself
in the gardens. On proceeding to the treasury,
the King discovered the hole, which had evidently
been the work of a mouse. From these circumstances
he began to suspect the truth of the vizier’s information,
and at last being convinced that the Merchant
was innocent, he ordered the vizier to be punished.
He lamented exceedingly the hard fate of the Merchant,
and was much grieved at his own precipitancy;
but his condolence and his sorrow were of no avail.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c009'>Having related this story, Bakhtyār observed, that
the King would have prevented all this distress had he
taken some time to inquire into the affair, and entreated
a further respite, that he might be enabled to prove his
innocence.—The King, being pleased with the recital
of this story, complied with Bakhtyār’s request, and
ordered him to be taken back to prison for that day.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER III.</h3>
</div>

<div class='c008'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/i_033.jpg' width='100' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
On the following morning the third Vizier presented
himself before the King, and, having
paid his respects, expressed many apprehensions
that the indulgence shown to Bakhtyār might prove of
dangerous consequences, by encouraging other criminals,
and strongly advised his speedy execution. The
King, having sent for Bakhtyār, the executioner prepared
to blindfold him; but he petitioned for mercy,
and said: “The imprisonment of suspected persons
is certainly a just measure, as the guilt or innocence
of the prisoner will probably be ascertained in the
course of time; but if a King will not have patience,
but punish without due investigation of the offence,
what can result from such precipitancy but affliction
and repentance? Thus it happened to a son of the
King of Aleppo, whose impatience occasioned the loss
of that kingdom, and infinite misery.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>The King’s curiosity being excited, he desired Bakhtyār
to relate the story of the Impatient Prince of
Aleppo; and Bakhtyār, having kissed the ground
of obedience, thus began:</p>

<h4 class='c020'>STORY OF THE IMPATIENT PRINCE OF ALEPPO.</h4>

<p class='c021'>The King of Aleppo was an upright and generous
monarch, who protected strangers and permitted not
any person to oppress or insult another; and he had
a son named Bihzād, a young man of excellent genius,
polite accomplishments, and many good qualities; but
so very impatient, that he would not admit a moment’s
delay in the gratification of any desire, whatsoever
might be the consequences of his rash haste.</p>

<p class='c009'>It happened once, that, being seated with several
of his companions, he desired one of them to relate
his adventures. The young man accordingly began his
story in the following words:</p>

<p class='c009'>“About two years ago, being in possession of considerable
wealth, I purchased several beasts of burthen,
and, having loaded them with various commodities,
I undertook a journey, but on the way was attacked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>by robbers, who plundered me of all my property, and
I proceeded with a disconsolate heart until night came
on, and I found myself in a place without any vestige
of inhabitants. I took shelter beneath a great tree,
and had remained there for some time, when I perceived
a light, and several persons who passed by with
much festivity and mirth. After them came some who
held vessels full of burning incense, so very fragrant,
that the desert was perfumed by its delightful odour.
When they had passed on, a magnificent litter appeared,
before which walked several damsels holding
torches, scented with ambergris. In this litter was
seated a fair one, of such exquisite beauty, that the
radiance of her charms far exceeded the light of
the torches, and quite dazzled my fascinated eyes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When the young man had advanced thus far in his
narrative, Bihzād began to show symptoms of impatience,
having fallen in love with the lady, though
unseen. The young man continued his story, and
said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The next morning I proceeded on my journey,
and arrived at the city of Rūm, the capital and residence
of the Kaisar, or Greek Emperor; and having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>made inquiries, I was informed that the beautiful
damsel whom I had seen was the Princess Nigārīn,
daughter of the Kaisar, who had a villa at a little
distance from the city, to which she sometimes went
for recreation.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Here the young man concluded his narrative, and
Prince Bihzād immediately arose and hastened to the
house of the vizier, and said: “You must go this
moment to my father, and tell him that if he is
solicitous about my happiness, he will provide me
a wife without delay.” The vizier accordingly went
to the palace and informed the King of Bihzād’s
wishes. The King desired the vizier to assure the
Prince that he only waited to find a suitable match
for him; but that, if he had fixed his affections on
any fair object, he would do everything in his power
to obtain her for him.</p>

<p class='c009'>This being reported to Bihzād, he sent back the
vizier with another message to the King, informing him
that the object of his choice was the Princess Nigārīn,
the lovely daughter of the Kaisar of Rūm, and requesting
that ambassadors might be sent to ask her in
marriage for him. The King replied to this message,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>and said: “Tell Bihzād that it were in vain for me to
send ambassadors on such an errand to the Kaisar:
he is the powerful Emperor of Rūm, and I am only a
petty sovereign of Aleppo; we are of different religions
and of different manners; and there is not any probability
that he would comply with our demand.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The vizier returned to Bihzād, and delivered him
this message from his father. The impatient Prince
immediately declared that, if the King would not
send ambassadors to solicit the Kaisar’s daughter in
marriage for him, he would set out on that errand
himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>The King, being informed of his son’s resolution,
sent for the Prince, whom he loved with a tender
affection, and at last consented that ambassadors
should be despatched to Rūm. The Kaisar received
with due respect the ambassadors from the King of
Aleppo; but when they disclosed the object of their
mission, he replied, with great indignation, and informed
them, that no one should obtain his daughter
without paying the sum of one hundred lacs of dīnars
(or pieces of gold); and that whoever should consent
to pay that sum might become her husband.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>The ambassadors returned to Aleppo, and related
to the King all that the Kaisar had said. “Did I not
tell you,” said the King to Bihzād, “that the Greek
Emperor would refuse his consent to so unequal a
match?”—“He has not refused his consent,” replied
Bihzād; “but he requires money, which must be immediately
sent.”—The King declared that he could
not make up so considerable a sum; but, at Bihzād’s
request, having collected all his wealth, he found he
possessed thirty lacs. Bihzād then urged him to sell
his male and female slaves, and all his household
goods. Having done so, he found that they produced
twenty lacs.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Bihzād advised the King to make up the
requisite sum, by compelling his subjects to contribute
their money; but the King was not willing to distress
his people. However, by the persuasion of Bihzād,
he extorted from them an additional sum of twenty
lacs. Having thus collected seventy lacs of dīnars,
Bihzād proposed that they should be immediately
transmitted to the Kaisar of Rūm. Letters were
accordingly written, and messengers despatched with
the money, who were instructed to say, that the remaining
sum of thirty lacs should speedily be sent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>after. When these messengers arrived at Rūm, they
presented the letters and gifts to the Kaisar, with the
money. He treated the messengers with great respect,
accepted the money, and agreed to the proposed conditions;
after which they returned to Aleppo, and
reported their success. Bihzād then urged his father
to collect by any means the thirty lacs of dīnars still
deficient, either by a forced loan from the merchants,
or by taxing the peasants of the country; but the
King advised him to be patient, and wait until they
should recover from the effects of the late exactions;
and said: “You have already rendered me poor, and
now you wish to complete my ruin, and occasion the
loss of my kingdom.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Bihzād desired his father to keep his kingdom, and
declared his intention of setting out immediately.
The King, much afflicted at the thought of his son’s
departure, entreated him to wait one year, that the
people might forget the sums they had already paid;
but Bihzād would not consent. The King then begged
that he would be patient for six months; this also he
refused.—“Wait even three months,” said his father.—“I
cannot wait three days,” said the impatient
youth. On which the King, disgusted with such obstinacy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>desired his son to go wherever he pleased.
Bihzād immediately retired; and, having clothed himself
in armour, with two confidential servants set out
upon his journey.</p>

<p class='c009'>It happened that one morning they overtook a caravan,
consisting of a hundred camels loaded with valuable
commodities, proceeding on the way to Rūm.
The chief of this caravan was a man of considerable
wealth, with a numerous train of attendants, and he
was held in great esteem by the Kaisar. When Bihzād
and his two companions espied the caravan, they
rushed forward with loud shouts, but were instantly
seized, and their hands and feet bound: they were
then brought before the chief, who ordered that they
should be flung upon a camel. When they arrived at
Rūm, the chief took Bihzād to his own house, and
kept him confined for three days.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the third day, having looked attentively at his
prisoner, he discovered in his air and manner something
that bespoke his princely origin and education.
He inquired into the circumstances of his adventure,
but Bihzād answered only with tears. The chief then
said: “If you tell me the truth of this affair, I will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>set you free; and if you do not, I shall inform the
Kaisar of your offence, and he will cause you to be
hanged.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Bihzād, not knowing what else to do, related his
whole history to the chief of the caravan, who, moved
with compassion, desired him not to despair, for
he would lend him the thirty lacs of dīnars, and
procure him the Kaisar’s daughter, on condition of
his being repaid whenever Bihzād should become
king.</p>

<p class='c009'>To this Bihzād gladly consented; and the chief,
having unloosed his fetters, clothed him in royal
garments, and dressed his servants also in splendid
attire; and having given him thirty lacs of dīnars,
he led him to the palace: then he left Bihzād at
the door, whilst he himself went in and informed the
Kaisar that the Prince of Aleppo was waiting for the
honour of presenting to his Majesty the thirty lacs of
dīnars, which he had brought sealed up.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Kaisar consented to receive Bihzād, who, on
being introduced, paid due homage, and was treated
with great kindness, and placed by the Kaisar’s side.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>After much conversation, the Kaisar desired him to
declare the object of his wishes, and promised that,
whatever it might be, he would endeavour to procure
it for him. Bihzād replied, that his only desire in
this world was to obtain the Princess for his wife.
The Kaisar begged that he would wait ten days; but
to this delay he would not consent. The Kaisar then
entreated that he would be patient for five days; and
this also he refused to do.—“At least,” said the Kaisar,
“wait three days, that the women may have time to
make the necessary preparations.” But Bihzād would
not consent.—“This one day, however,” then said the
Kaisar, “you must be patient, and to-morrow you
shall espouse my daughter.”—“Since it must be so,”
replied Bihzād, “I’ll wait this day, but no longer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Kaisar gave orders that the Princess should be
brought to the garden of the palace, and all the nobles
assembled, and banquets provided for the entertainment
of Bihzād. When night came, Bihzād, having indulged
in wine, became impatient to behold the Princess, and,
going to the summer-house, in which she was, he discovered
an aperture in the wall, to which he applied
his eye. The Princess at that moment happened to
perceive the aperture, and found that some person was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>looking at her through it.  She immediately ordered
her attendants to burn out his eyes with red-hot irons.</p>

<p class='c009'>This order was put in execution without delay. The
unhappy Bihzād, crying aloud, fell on the ground,
deprived of sight. His voice being at length recognised,
the servants ran out and beheld him rolling
in agony on the ground. They exclaimed, and tore
their hair, but all in vain. The news was brought to
the Kaisar, who said: “What can be done? This
silly youth has brought the evil on himself by his own
impatience, and has occasioned the loss of his own eyes.”
He then directed that Bihzād should be sent back to
Aleppo, as he could not give his daughter to a person
deprived of sight.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the unhappy youth returned to Aleppo, his
father and mother, and the inhabitants of the city, all
wept at his misfortunes; but their compassion was of
no avail. After some time the King died; but the
people introduced a stranger, and placed him on the
throne, saying that a blind man was not capable of
governing. And the remainder of Bihzād’s life passed
away in misery, and in repentance for his rashness
and impatience.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>“Now,” added Bakhtyār, “had that unfortunate
young man waited until night, the Princess Nigārīn
would have been his, and he would have saved his
eyes and his kingdom, and not have had occasion to
repent of impatience. If the King will send me back
to prison, he will not be sorry for the delay, as my
innocence will hereafter appear; and if he hasten my
execution, any future repentance will not avail.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The King ordered Bakhtyār to go back to prison
for that day.</p>

On the following day, the fourth Vizier presented
himself before the King, and, having paid his
respects, advised him not to defer any longer
the execution of Bakhtyār. The King immediately
gave orders that the young man should be brought
from the prison; the executioner with a drawn sword
stood ready to perform his part, when Bakhtyār exclaimed:
“Long be the King’s life! Let him not be
precipitate in putting me to death; but as I have, in
the story of Bihzād, described the fatal consequences
of rashness, let me be permitted to celebrate the
blessings attendant on forbearance, and recount the
adventures of Abū Saber, the Patient Man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The King’s curiosity being excited, he desired Bakhtyār
to relate the story, which he accordingly began in
the following words:</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>
  <h4 class='c020'>STORY OF ABŪ SABER; OR, THE PATIENT MAN.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c021'>There lived in a certain village, a worthy man, whose
principal riches consisted in a good understanding
and an inexhaustible stock of patience. On account
of those qualifications he was so much respected by
all his neighbours, that his advice was followed on
every occasion of importance.</p>

<p class='c009'>It happened once that a tax-gatherer came to this
village, and extorted from the poor peasants their
miserable pittance, with such circumstances of cruelty
and injustice that they could not any longer submit
to the oppression: a number of the young men, having
assembled in a body, slew the tax-gatherer and fled.</p>

<p class='c009'>The other inhabitants, who had not been concerned
in this transaction, came to Abū Saber, and
begged that he would accompany them to the King,
and relate to his Majesty the circumstances as they
had happened; but Abū Saber told them, that he
had drank of the sherbet of patience, and would not
intermeddle in such affairs. When the King was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>informed of the tax-gatherer’s death, he ordered his
servants to punish the people of that village, and to
strip them of all their property.</p>

<p class='c009'>After two years it happened that a lion took up his
abode in the neighbourhood, and destroyed so many
children that no person would venture to cultivate the
ground, or attend the harvest, from fear of being devoured.
In this distress the villagers went to Abū
Saber, and entreated him to associate with them in
some measure for their relief; but he replied, that
patience was his only remedy.</p>

<p class='c009'>It happened soon after, that the King, being on a
hunting-party, arrived in the vicinity of this place;
and the inhabitants, presenting themselves before him,
related the story of the tax-gatherer, the consequences
of the King’s anger, and their dread of the lion. The
King pitying them, asked why they had not sent some
person to inform him of their distresses. They replied,
that Abū Saber, the chief man of the village,
whose assistance they solicited, had declined interfering
in the matter. The King, hearing this, was
enraged, and gave orders that Abū Saber should be
driven forth from the village. These orders were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>instantly put in execution, and the King sent people
to destroy the lion.</p>

<p class='c009'>With a heavy heart, Abū Saber commenced his
journey, accompanied by his wife and two sons. It
happened that they were soon overtaken by some robbers,
who, not perceiving any thing more valuable of
which they might strip him, resolved to carry off the
two boys and sell them; they accordingly seized the
poor children and bore them away. The wife began
to cry and weep most bitterly; but Abū Saber recommended
patience. They then proceeded on their
journey, and travelled all night and all day, till, faint
from hunger and thirst, weary and fatigued, they at
length approached a village, in the outlets of which
Abū Saber left his wife, whilst he went to procure some
food. He was employed on this business in the village,
when a robber happened to discover the woman,
and seeing that she was a stranger, handsome, and
unprotected, he seized her with violence, and declared
that he would take her as his wife. After many tears
and supplications, finding the robber determined to
carry her away, she contrived to write upon the
ground with blood, which she had procured by biting
her own finger. When Abū Saber returned from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>village, and sought his wife in the spot where he had
left her, the words which she had written sufficiently
explained the occasion of her absence.</p>

<p class='c009'>He wept at this new misfortune, and implored the
Almighty to bestow patience on his wife, and enable
her to bear whatever should befall her.</p>

<p class='c009'>With a disconsolate heart, Abū Saber proceeded on
his solitary journey, until he came to the gate of a
certain city where a King resided, who was very tyrannical
and impious. And it happened at this time that
he had ordered a summer-house to be erected, and
every stranger who approached the city was by his
command seized and compelled to work, guarded
day and night, and fed with a scanty portion of coarse
black bread.</p>

<p class='c009'>Abū Saber was immediately seized and dragged to
the building; when a heavy load was placed upon his
shoulders, and he was obliged to ascend a ladder of
seventy steps. In this distress he consoled himself
by reflections on the advantages of patience, the only
remedy within his power, for the evils which had occurred.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>It happened on this day, that the King was sitting
in a corner of the building, superintending the work,
when he overheard Abū Saber inquire of another man,
what time they might expect to be relieved from
this excessive fatigue. The man informed Abū Saber
that it was three months since he had been thus laboriously
employed, and languishing for a sight of his
beloved wife and children. “During this space of
time,” added he, “I have not had any intelligence of
them; and I long for permission to visit them, were
it but for one night.” Abū Saber desired him to be
patient; for Providence would relieve him at last from
the oppression under which he suffered.</p>

<p class='c009'>All this conversation the King overheard. After
some time Abū Saber, being faint from excessive
fatigue, fell senseless from the steps of the ladder, by
which accident his legs and arms were dislocated.
The King, however, provoked to anger by what he
had heard, ordered that Abū Saber should be brought
before him, and, having upbraided him with inconsistency
in recommending patience to another person,
when he himself could not practise it, he ordered
him to be punished with fifty stripes and thrown into
prison. This sentence was immediately put into execution,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>and Abū Saber, supporting his head on the
knees of patience, implored the protection of the
Almighty, with perfect submission to His divine dispensations.</p>

<p class='c009'>After some time had elapsed, it happened that the
King was affected one night by a violent cholic, of
which he died in excessive agony; and as he did not
leave any heir to the crown, the people of the city
assembled in order to elect a King.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was resolved that they should go to the prison,
and propose three questions to the criminals confined
there; and that whoever gave the best answer should
be chosen King. In consequence of this resolution,
they proceeded to the prison, and asked the three
questions, to which none of the prisoners replied, except
Abū Saber, whose answers were so ingenious,
that he was borne triumphantly away, washed in a
warm bath, clothed in royal garments, and placed
upon the throne; after which all the inhabitants came
and paid him homage. And he governed with such
mildness and wisdom, that the people night and day
offered up their prayers for him; and the fame of his
justice and liberality was spread all over the world.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>One day it happened that two men attended at
his tribunal and demanded an audience. Abū Saber
caused them to be brought before him. One of those
men was a merchant, and the other the robber who
had carried off the sons of Abū Saber. The robber
he immediately recognised, but was silent. The merchant
then addressed him, and said: “Long be the
King’s life! This man sold to me two boys; and
after some time these boys began to say, ‘We are
freemen—we are the sons of a Mussulman; and that
man carried us away by force, and sold us, at which
time, from fear of him, we were afraid to say that we
were freemen.’ Now,” added the merchant, “let the
King order this man to return me the money, and
take back the boys.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Abū Saber then asked the robber what he had to
say. The man answered, that it was the merchant’s
fault, who had not taken good care of the boys; but
that for his own part he had always treated them well,
which induced them to make this complaint, in order
that he might take them back. Abū Saber then sent
for the two boys, who proved to be his own sons. He
knew them, but they had not any recollection of him.
He desired them to explain this matter; and they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>declared that the robber had carried them away from
their father and mother to his own dwelling, and had
desired them not to say, on any account, that they
were freemen; but that when sold as slaves they could
not any longer suppress their complaints. Abū Saber,
much affected by their story, ordered them to tell their
names, and then sent them to his own apartments;
after which he caused the robber to be imprisoned,
and the merchant’s money to be deposited in the
public treasury.</p>

<p class='c009'>On another day it happened that two persons in
like manner solicited an audience of the King. When
they were admitted, one proved to be the wife of Abū
Saber, and the other the man who had taken her away
by force. But Abū Saber did not know his wife, because
she wore her veil. The robber, having paid his
respects, informed the King that this woman, who had
lived with him for some time, would not consent to
perform the duties of a wife. Abū Saber addressed
the woman, and asked her why she refused to obey
her husband. She immediately answered, that this
man was not her husband; that she was the wife of
a person named Abū Saber; and that this man had
taken her to his house against her inclination.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>Abū Saber ordered his servants to take the woman
to his harem; and, having made a proclamation and
assembled all the inhabitants of the city, caused the
robber who had taken away his sons and the man
who had carried off his wife to be brought before
them; and, having explained the nature of their offences
and related the circumstances of his own story,
he gave orders for their execution.</p>

<p class='c009'>After this he passed the remainder of his life in
peaceful enjoyment of the supreme power, which at
his death devolved upon his son, and continued for
many generations in the family, as the reward of his
patience.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c009'>Here Bakhtyār concluded his story, and by order
of the King was sent back to prison.</p>

  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/i_055.jpg' width='100' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
When the next morning arrived, the fifth Vizier
waited upon the King, and represented the
danger that might attend any further delay
in the execution of Bakhtyār, as the indulgence which
had been shown to him would be an encouragement
to others, and induce them to commit offences, by
giving them hopes of impunity. In consequence of
this, the King ordered everything to be prepared for
the execution of the young man, who, being brought
before him, entreated his Majesty for a longer respite,
and assured him that he would, on a future day, be as
rejoiced at having spared his life, as a certain King
of Yemen was at having pardoned the offence of his
slave.</p>

<p class='c009'>The King desired Bakhtyār to relate the particular
circumstances of this story; and he accordingly began
it in the following manner:</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>
  <h4 class='c020'>STORY OF THE KING OF YEMEN AND HIS SLAVE ABRAHA.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c021'>In former times the kingdom of Yemen was governed
by a very powerful but tyrannical Prince, who, for the
slightest offences, inflicted the most severe punishments.
He had, however, a certain slave, named
Abraha, of whom he was very fond. This young
man was the son of the King of Zangībār, who by
chance had fallen into slavery, and never disclosed
the secret of his birth.</p>

<p class='c009'>Abraha used frequently to attend the King of
Yemen on his hunting parties. During one of these
excursions, it happened that a deer bounded before
the King’s horse: he discharged some arrows at it
without effect; when Abraha, who was close behind
him, spurred on his horse, and aimed a broad-bladed
arrow at the deer; but it so happened that the arrow
passed by the side of the King’s head, and cut off one
of his ears. The King, in the first impulse of anger,
ordered his attendants to seize Abraha; but afterwards
declared that he pardoned his offence.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>They then returned to the city; and, after some
time had elapsed, having gone on board a vessel and
sailed into the ocean, a tempest arose, and the ship
was wrecked, and the King saved himself by clinging
to a plank, and was driven on the coast of Zangībār.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having returned thanks to Providence for his preservation,
he proceeded till he reached the chief city
of that country. As it was night, the doors of the
houses and all the shops were shut; and, not knowing
where he might find a better place of repose, he
sheltered himself under the shade of a merchant’s
house. It happened that some thieves, in the course
of the night, broke open the house, and having murdered
the merchant and his servants, plundered it of
everything that was valuable. The King of Yemen,
overcome by fatigue, had slept the whole time, unconscious
of this transaction; but some of the blood
had by accident fallen on his clothes.</p>

<p class='c009'>When morning came, everybody was employed in
endeavouring to discover the murderers of the merchant;
and the stranger, being found so near the
house, with blood upon his clothes, was immediately
seized and dragged before the tribunal of the King.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>The King of Zangībār asked him why he had
chosen his capital as the scene of such an infamous
murder; and desired him to acknowledge who were
his accomplices, and how he had disposed of the merchant’s
property. The King of Yemen declared that
he was innocent, and perfectly ignorant of the whole
transaction; that he was of a princely family; and,
having been shipwrecked, was driven on the coast, and
had by accident reposed himself under the shade of
that house when the murder was committed. The
King of Zangībār then inquired of him by what means
his clothes had become stained with blood, and finding
that the stranger could not account for that circumstance,
he ordered the officers of justice to lead him
away to execution. The unfortunate King of Yemen
entreated for mercy, and asserted that his innocence
would on some future day become apparent. The
King consented to defer his execution for a while,
and he was sent to prison.</p>

<p class='c009'>On one side of the prison there was an extensive
plain, with a running stream, to which every day the
prisoners were brought, that they might wash themselves;
and it was the custom that once every week
the King resorted to that plain, where he gave public
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>audience to persons of all ranks. On one of those
days the King of Zangībār was on the plain, surrounded
by his troops, and the prisoners were sitting by the side
of the stream, along which ran a wall of the prison.
It happened that Abraha, who had been the King of
Yemen’s slave, was standing near this wall, but his
former master did not recognise him, as they had
been separated for some time, Abraha having found
means to return to Zangībār, his native country.</p>

<p class='c009'>At this moment a crow chanced to light upon the
wall, which the King of Yemen perceived, and taking
up a large flat bone, he threw it with his utmost
strength, and exclaimed, “If I succeed in hitting
that crow, I shall obtain my liberty,” but he missed
his aim; the bone passed by the crow, and striking
the cheek of Abraha, cut off one of his ears. Abraha
immediately caused an inquiry to be made, and the
person who had thrown the bone to be brought before
the King, who called him a base-born dog, and ordered
the executioner to cut off his head. The King
of Yemen sued for mercy, and requested that at most
he might be punished according to the law of retaliation,
which would not award a head for an ear. The
King gave orders that one of his ears should be cut
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>off; and the executioner was preparing to fulfil this
sentence when he perceived that the prisoner had
already lost an ear.</p>

<p class='c009'>This circumstance occasioned much surprise, and
excited the King’s curiosity. He told the prisoner
that he would pardon him, on condition of his relating
the true story of his adventures.</p>

<p class='c009'>The King of Yemen immediately disclosed his real
name and rank, described the accident by which he
lost his ear, the shipwreck which he suffered, and the
circumstances which occasioned his imprisonment.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the conclusion of his narrative, Abraha, having
recognised his former master, fell at his feet, embraced
him, and wept. They mutually forgave each other;
and the King of Yemen, being taken to a warm bath,
was clothed in royal garments, mounted on a noble
charger, and conducted to the palace; after which he
was furnished with a variety of splendid robes and
suits of armour, horses, slaves, and damsels. During
two months he was feasted and entertained with the
utmost hospitality and magnificence, attended constantly
by Abraha. In the course of this time, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>robbers who had murdered the merchant were discovered
and punished; and after that the King of
Yemen returned to his own country.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c009'>Bakhtyār having thus demonstrated that appearances
might be very strong against an innocent person, the
King resolved to defer his execution for another day,
and he was accordingly led back to prison.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>

</div>

<div class='c008'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/i_062.jpg' width='100' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
On the following day the sixth Vizier, having
paid his respects to the King, represented the
danger of letting an enemy live when in one’s
power, and, by many artful speeches, induced his
Majesty to order the execution of Bakhtyār, who was
immediately brought from the prison. When he
came before the King, he persisted in declaring his
innocence, and advised him not to be precipitate, like
King Dādīn, in putting to death a person on the
malicious accusation of an enemy. The King, desirous
of hearing the story to which Bakhtyār alluded,
ordered him to relate it; and he began as follows:</p>

<h4 class='c020'>STORY OF KING DĀDĪN AND HIS TWO VIZIERS.</h4>

<p class='c021'>There was a certain King named Dādīn, who had
two viziers, Kārdār and Kāmgār; and the daughter of
Kāmgār was the most lovely creature of the age. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>happened that the King, proceeding on a hunting excursion,
took along with him the father of this beautiful
damsel, and left the charge of government in the
hands of Kārdār.</p>

<p class='c009'>One day, during the warm season, Kārdār, passing
near the palace of Kāmgār, beheld this fair damsel
walking in the garden, and became enamoured of her
beauty; but having reason to believe that her father
would not consent to bestow her on him, he resolved
to devise some stratagem whereby he might obtain
the object of his desires. “At the King’s return from
the chase,” said he, “I’ll represent the charms of this
damsel in such glowing colours, that he will not fail
to demand her in marriage; and I’ll then contrive to
excite his anger against her, in consequence of which
he shall deliver her to me for punishment; and thus
my designs shall be accomplished.”</p>

<p class='c009'>One day after the King’s return from the hunting
party, he desired Kārdār to inform him of the principal
events which had occurred during his absence.
Kārdār replied that his Majesty’s subjects had all
been solicitous for his prosperity; but that he had
himself seen one of the most astonishing objects of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>the universe. The King’s curiosity being thus excited,
he ordered Kārdār to describe what he had seen;
and Kārdār dwelt with such praises on the fascinating
charms of Kāmgār’s daughter, that the King became
enamoured of her, and said: “But how is this damsel
to be obtained?”—Kārdār replied: “There is not
any difficulty in this business; it is not necessary to
employ either money or messengers: your Majesty
needs only to acquaint her father with your wishes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The King approved of this counsel, and having sent
for Kāmgār, mentioned the affair to him accordingly.
Kāmgār, with due submission, declared that if he possessed
a hundred daughters they should all be at his
Majesty’s command; but begged permission to retire
and inform the damsel of the honour designed for her.
Having obtained leave, he hastened to his daughter,
and related to her all that had passed between the King
and him. The damsel expressed her dislike to the
proposed connection; and her father, dreading the
King’s anger in case of a refusal, knew not how to act.
“Contrive some delay,” said she; “solicit leave of
absence for a few days, and let us fly from this
country!” Kāmgār approved of this advice; and
having waited on the King, obtained leave to absent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>himself from court for ten days, under pretence of
making the preparations necessary for a female on
the eve of matrimony; and when night came on, he
fled from the city with his daughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next day the King was informed of their flight; in
consequence of which he sent off two hundred servants
to seek them in various directions, and the officious
Kārdār set out also in pursuit of them. After ten days
they were surprised by the side of a well, taken and
bound, and brought before the King, who, in his
anger, dashed out the brains of Kāmgār; then looking
on the daughter of the unfortunate man, her beauty
so much affected him, that he sent her to his palace,
and appointed servants to attend her, besides a cook,
who, at his own request, was added to her establishment.
After some time Kārdār became impatient, and
enraged at the failure of his project; but he resolved
to try the success of another scheme.</p>

<p class='c009'>It happened that the encroachments of a powerful
enemy rendered the King’s presence necessary among
the troops; and on setting out to join the army, he
committed the management of affairs and the government
of the city to Kārdār, whose mind was wholly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>filled with stratagems for getting the daughter of
Kāmgār into his power.</p>

<p class='c009'>One day he was passing near the palace, and discovered
her sitting alone on the balcony; to attract
her attention, he threw up a piece of brick or tile, and
on her looking down to see from whence it came she
beheld Kārdār. He addressed her with the usual
salutation, which she returned. He then began to
declare his admiration of her beauty, and the violence
of his love, which deprived him of repose both day
and night; and concluded by urging her to elope
with him, saying that he would take as much money
as they could possibly want; or, if she would consent,
he was ready to destroy the King by poison, and seize
upon the throne himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>The daughter of Kāmgār replied to this proposal
by upbraiding Kārdār with his baseness and perfidy.
When he asked her how she could ever fix her affections
on the man who had killed her father, she answered,
that such had been the will of God, and she
was resolved to submit accordingly. Having spoken
thus, she retired. Kārdār, fearing lest she should
relate to the King what had passed between them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>hastened to meet him as he returned in triumph after
conquering his enemies; and whilst walking along by
the side of the King’s horse, began to inform his
Majesty of all that had happened in his absence.
Having mentioned several occurrences, he added, that
one circumstance was of such a nature that he could
not prevail on himself to relate it, for it was such as the
King would be very much displeased at hearing.</p>

<p class='c009'>The King’s curiosity being thus excited, he ordered
Kārdār to relate this occurrence; and he, declaring
that it was a most ungrateful task, informed him that
it was a maxim of the wise men: “When you have
killed the serpent, you should also kill its young.”
He then proceeded to relate that, one day during the
warm season, being seated near the door of the harem,
he overheard some voices, and his suspicions being
excited, he concealed himself behind the hangings,
and listened attentively, when he heard the daughter
of Kāmgār express her affection for the cook, who, in
return, declared his attachment; and they spoke of
poisoning the King in revenge for his having killed
her father. “I had not patience,” added Kārdār,
“to listen any longer.”—At this intelligence the King
changed colour with rage and indignation, and on arriving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>at the palace, ordered the unfortunate cook to
be instantly cut in two. He then sent for the daughter
of Kāmgār, and upbraided her with the intention of
destroying him by poison. She immediately perceived
that this accusation proceeded from the malevolence
of Kārdār, and was going to speak in vindication of
herself, when the King ordered her to be put to
death; but being dissuaded by an attendant from
killing a woman, he revoked the sentence of death;
and she was tied hands and feet, and placed upon
a camel, which was turned into a dreary wilderness,
where there was neither water nor shade, nor any
trace of cultivation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here she suffered from the intense heat and thirst,
to such a degree that, expecting every moment to be
her last, she resigned herself to the will of Providence,
conscious of her own innocence. Just then the camel
lay down, and on that spot where they were a fountain
of delicious water sprang forth; the cords which bound
her hands and feet dropped off: she refreshed herself
by a hearty draught of the water, and fervently returned
thanks to Heaven for this blessing and her wonderful
preservation. On this the most verdant and fragrant
herbage appeared around the borders of the fountain;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>it became a blooming and delightful spot, and the
camel placed himself so as to afford his lovely companion
a shade and shelter from the sunbeams.</p>

<p class='c009'>It happened that one of the King’s camel-keepers
was at this time in pursuit of some camels which had
wandered into the desert, and without which he dared
not return to the city. He had sought them for several
days amidst hills and forests without any success.
At length on coming to this spot he beheld the daughter
of Kāmgār and the camel, which at first he thought
was one of those he sought, and the clear fountain
with the verdant banks, where neither grass nor water
had ever been seen before. Astonished at this discovery,
he resolved not to interrupt the lady, who was
engaged in prayer; but when she had finished, he
addressed her, and was so charmed by her gentleness
and piety, that he offered to adopt her as his child,
and expressed his belief that, through the efficacy of
her prayers, he should recover the strayed camels.</p>

<p class='c009'>This good man’s offer she thankfully accepted; and
having partaken of a fowl and some bread which he
had with him, at his request she prayed for the recovery
of his camels. As soon as she had concluded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>her prayer, the camels appeared on the skirts of the
wilderness, and of their own accord approached the
camel-keeper.</p>

<p class='c009'>He then represented to the daughter of Kāmgār
the danger of remaining all night in the wilderness,
which was the haunt of many wild beasts; and proposed
that she should return with him to the city, and
dwell with him in his house, where he would provide
for her a retired apartment, in which she might perform
her devotions without interruption. To this
proposal she consented, and being mounted on her
camel, she returned to the city, and arrived at the
house of her companion at the time of evening prayer.
Here she resided for some time, employing herself in
exercises of piety and devotion.</p>

<p class='c009'>One day the camel-keeper, being desired by the
King to relate his past adventures, mentioned, among
other circumstances, the losing of his camels, the finding
them through the efficacy of a young woman’s prayers,
the discovery of a spring where none had been before,
and his adopting the damsel as his daughter: he concluded
by telling the King that she was now at his
house, and employed day and night in acts of devotion.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>The King, on hearing this, expressed an earnest
wish that he might be allowed to see this young
woman, and prevail on her to intercede with Providence
in his behalf. The camel-keeper, having consented,
returned at once to his house accompanied by
the King, who waited at the door of the apartment
where the daughter of Kāmgār was engaged in prayer.
When she had concluded he approached, and with
astonishment recognised her. Having tenderly embraced
her, he wept, and entreated her forgiveness.
This she readily granted, but begged that he would
conceal himself in the apartment whilst she should
converse with Kārdār, whom she sent for.</p>

<p class='c009'>When he arrived, and beheld her with a thousand
expressions of fondness, he inquired the means whereby
she had escaped; and he told her that on the day
when the King had banished her into the wilderness,
he had sent people to seek her, and to bring her to
him. “How much better would it have been,” added
he, “had you followed my advice, and agreed to my
proposal of poisoning the King, who, I said, would
endeavour to destroy you, as he had killed your
father! But you rejected my advice, and declared
yourself ready to submit to whatsoever Providence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>should decree. Hereafter,” continued he, “you will
pay more attention to my words. But now let us not
think of what is past: I am your slave, and you are
dearer to me than my own eyes!” So saying, he attempted
to clasp the daughter of Kāmgār in his arms,
when the King, who was concealed behind the hangings,
rushed furiously on him, and put him to death.
After this he conducted the damsel to his palace, and
constantly lamented his precipitancy in having killed
her father.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c009'>Here Bakhtyār concluded the story; and having
requested a further respite, that he might have an
opportunity of proving his innocence, he was sent
back to prison by order of the King.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
The Seventh Vizier, on the following day, approached
the King, and having told him that
his lenity towards Bakhtyār was made the
subject of public conversation, added many arguments
to procure an order for the execution of that unfortunate
young man. The King, changing colour
with anger, sent immediately for the Queen, and
asked her advice concerning Bakhtyār. She declared
that he deserved death; in consequence of
which the King ordered his attendants to bring him
from the prison. When he came into the royal
presence, he begged for mercy, saying: “My innocence
will appear hereafter; and though your Majesty
can easily put to death a living man, you cannot
restore a dead man to life.”—“How,” said the King,
“can you deny your guilt, since the women of the
harem all bear witness against you?”—Bakhtyār replied:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“Women, for their own purposes, often devise
falsehoods, and are very expert in artifice and fraud,
as appears from the story of the daughter of the
King of `Irāk and her adventures with the King of
Abyssinia, which, if your Majesty permit, I shall briefly
relate.”—Having obtained permission, he began the
story as follows:</p>

<h4 class='c020'>STORY OF THE KING OF ABYSSINIA, SHOWING THE ARTIFICE OF WOMEN.</h4>

<p class='c021'>It is related that Abyssinia was once governed by a
certain monarch, whose armies were very numerous,
and his treasury well filled; but not having any enemy
to engage him in war, he neglected his troops, and
withheld their pay, so that they were reduced to great
distress, and began to murmur, and at last made their
complaints to the Vizier. He, pitying their situation,
promised that he would take measures for their relief,
and desired them to be patient for a little while. He
then considered within himself what steps he should
take; and at length, knowing the King’s inclination to
women, and understanding that the Princess of `Irāk
was uncommonly beautiful, he resolved to praise her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>charms in such extravagant language before the King,
as to induce him to demand her from her father, who,
from his excessive fondness, would not probably consent
to bestow her on him, and thus a war would ensue,
in which case the troops should be employed, and their
arrears paid off.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pleased with the ingenuity of this stratagem, the
vizier hastened to the King, and after conversing
for some time on various subjects, he contrived to
mention the King of `Irāk, and immediately described
the beauty of his daughter in such glowing colours,
that the King became enamoured, and consulted the
vizier on the means whereby he might hope to obtain
possession of that lovely Princess. The vizier replied,
that the first step was to send ambassadors to the King
of `Irāk, soliciting his daughter in marriage. In consequence
of this advice, some able and discreet persons
were despatched as ambassadors to `Irāk. On
their arrival in that country, the King received them
courteously; but when they disclosed the object of
their mission he became angry, and declared that he
would not comply with their demand.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ambassadors returned to Abyssinia, and having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>reported to the King the unsuccessful result of their
negotiation, he vowed that he would send an army
into `Irāk, and lay that country waste, unless his demands
were complied with.</p>

<p class='c009'>In consequence of this resolution, he ordered the
doors of his treasury to be thrown open, and caused
so much money to be distributed among the soldiers
that they were satisfied. From all quarters the troops
assembled, and zealously prepared for war. On the
other hand, the King of `Irāk levied his forces, and
sent them to oppose the Abyssinians, who invaded his
dominions; but he did not lead them to the field
himself, and they were defeated and put to flight.
When the account of this disaster reached the King
of `Irāk, he consulted his vizier, and asked what was
next to be done. The vizier candidly declared that
he did not think it necessary to prolong the war on
account of a woman, and advised his Majesty to send
ambassadors with overtures of peace, and an offer of
giving the Princess to the King of Abyssinia. This
advice the King of `Irāk followed, although reluctantly.
Ambassadors were despatched to the enemy with offers
of peace, and a declaration of the King’s consent to the
marriage of his daughter.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>These terms being accepted, the Princess was sent
with confidential attendants to the King of Abyssinia,
who retired with her to his own dominions, where he
espoused her; and some time passed away in festivity
and pleasure. But it happened that the King of `Irāk
had some years before given his daughter in marriage
to another man, by whom she had a son; and this
boy was now grown up, and accomplished in all
sciences, and such a favourite with the King of `Irāk,
that he would never permit him to be one hour absent
from him. The Princess, when obliged to leave
him, felt all the anxiety of a mother, and resolved to
devise some stratagem whereby she might enjoy his
society in Abyssinia.</p>

<p class='c009'>One day the King of Abyssinia, on some occasion,
behaved harshly to the Queen, and spoke disrespectfully
of her father. She in return said: “Your kingdom,
it is true, is most fertile and abundant; but
my father possesses such a treasure as no other
monarch can boast of—a youth sent to him by the
kindness of Heaven, skilled in every profound science,
and accomplished in every manly exercise; so that he
rather seems to be one of the inhabitants of Paradise
than of this earth.” These praises so excited the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>curiosity of the King, that he vowed he would bring
this boy to his court, were he even obliged to go
himself for him. The Queen replied: “My father
would be like a distracted person were he deprived,
even for an hour, of this boy’s society; but some intelligent
person must be sent to `Irāk in the character
of a merchant, and endeavour by every means to steal
him away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The King approved of this advice, and chose a person
well skilled in business, who had experienced many
reverses of fortune, and seen much of the world. To
this man he promised a reward of a hundred male
slaves and a hundred beautiful damsels, if he should
succeed in bringing away this boy from the King of
`Irāk’s court. The man inquired the name of the boy,
which was Farrukhzād, and, disguised as a merchant,
set out immediately for `Irāk.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having arrived there, he presented various offerings
to the King; and one day found an opportunity of
conversing with the boy. At last he said: “With
such accomplishments as you possess, were you in
Abyssinia for one day, you would be rendered master
of slaves and damsels, and riches of every kind.” He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>then described the delights of that country, which
made such an impression on Farrukhzād, that he became
disgusted with `Irāk, and attached himself to the
merchant, and said: “I have often heard of Abyssinia,
and have long wished to enjoy the pleasures which it
yields. The King’s daughter is now in that country,
and if I could contrive to go there, my happiness
would be complete. But I know not how to escape
from this place, as the King will not permit me to be
one hour absent from him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The merchant gladly undertook to devise some
means for the escape of Farrukhzād; and at last having
put him into a chest, and placed him upon a camel,
he contrived one evening to carry him off unnoticed.
The next day the King of `Irāk sent messengers in all
directions to seek him. They inquired of all the caravans
and travellers, but could not obtain any intelligence
concerning him. At last the merchant brought
him to Abyssinia, and the King, finding that his accomplishments
and talents had not been over-rated, was
much delighted with his society; and as he had not
any child, he bestowed on him a royal robe and crown,
a horse, a sword, and a shield, and adopted him as
his son, and brought him into the harem.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>When the Queen beheld Farrukhzād, she wept for
joy, embraced him, and kissed him with all the fondness
of a mother. It happened that one of the servants
was a witness, unperceived, of this interview.
He immediately hastened to the King, and represented
the transaction in such a manner as to excite all his
jealousy and rage. However, he resolved to inquire
into the matter; but Farrukhzād did not acknowledge
that the Queen was his mother; and when he sent for
her she answered his questions only by her tears.
From these circumstances he concluded that they
were guilty; and accordingly he ordered one of his
attendants to take away the young man to a burying-ground
without the city, and there to cut off his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>The attendant led Farrukhzād away, and was preparing
to put the King’s sentence into execution, but
when he looked in the youth’s face, his heart was
moved with compassion, and he said, “It must have
been the woman’s fault, and not his crime;” and he
resolved to save him. When he told Farrukhzād
that he would conceal him in his own house, the boy
was delighted, and promised that if ever it was in his
power he would reward him for his kindness. Having
taken him to his house, the man waited on the King,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>and told him that he had, in obedience to his orders,
put Farrukhzād to death.</p>

<p class='c009'>After this the King treated his wife with the utmost
coldness; and she sat melancholy, lamenting the absence
of her son. It happened that an old woman
beheld the Queen as she sat alone, weeping, in her
chamber. Pitying her situation, she approached,
and humbly inquired the occasion of her grief. The
Queen made no reply; but when the old woman promised,
not only to observe the utmost secrecy, if entrusted
with the story of her misfortunes, but to find
a remedy for them, she related at length all that had
happened, and disclosed the mystery of Farrukhzād’s
birth.</p>

<p class='c009'>The old woman desired the Queen to comfort herself,
and said: “This night, before the King retires
to rest, you must lay yourself down, and close your
eyes, as if asleep; he will then place something, which
I shall give him, on your bosom, and will command
you, by the power of the writing contained in that, to
reveal the truth. You must then begin to speak, and,
without any apprehension, repeat all that you have
now told me.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>The old woman, having then found that the King
was alone in his summer-house, presented herself
before him, and said: “O King, this solitary life
occasions melancholy and sadness!” The King replied
that it was not solitude which rendered him
melancholy, but vexation on account of the Queen’s
infidelity, and the ingratitude of Farrukhzād, on whom
he had heaped so many favours, and whom he had
adopted as his own son. “Yet,” added he, “I am
not convinced of his guilt; and since the day that I
caused him to be killed, I have not enjoyed repose, nor
am I certain whether the fault was his or the Queen’s.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let not the King be longer in suspense on this
subject,” said the old woman, “I have a certain talisman,
one of the talismans of Solomon, written in
Grecian characters, and in the Syrian language; if
your Majesty will watch an opportunity when the
Queen shall be asleep, and lay it on her breast,
and say: ‘O thou that sleepest! by virtue of the
talisman, and of the name of God, which it contains,
I conjure thee to speak to me, and to reveal all the
secrets of thy heart,’ she will immediately begin to
speak, and will declare everything that she knows,
both true and false.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>The King, delighted at the hopes of discovering the
truth by means of this talisman, desired the old
woman to fetch it. She accordingly went home, and
taking a piece of paper, scrawled on it some unmeaning
characters, folded it up, and tied it with a cord,
and sealed it with wax; then hastened to the King,
and desired him to preserve it carefully till night
should afford an opportunity of trying its efficacy.</p>

<p class='c009'>When it was night, the King watched until he found
that the Queen was in bed; then gently approaching,
and believing her to be asleep, he laid the talisman on
her breast, and repeated the words which the old
woman had taught him. The Queen, who had also
received her lesson, still affecting the appearance of
one asleep, immediately began to speak, and related
all the circumstances of her story.</p>

<p class='c009'>On hearing this the King was much affected, and
tenderly embraced the Queen, who started from her
bed as if perfectly unconscious of having revealed the
secrets of her breast. He then blamed her for not
having candidly acknowledged the circumstance of
Farrukhzād’s birth, who, he said, should have been
considered as his own son.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>All that night they passed in mutual condolence,
and on the next morning the King sent for the person
to whom he had delivered Farrukhzād, and desired
him to point out the spot where his body lay, that he
might perform the last duty to that unfortunate youth,
and ask forgiveness from his departed spirit. The
man replied: “It appears that your Majesty is ignorant
of Farrukhzād’s situation: he is at present in a place
of safety; for although you ordered me to kill him, I
ventured to disobey, and have concealed him in my
house, from whence, if you permit, I shall immediately
bring him.” At this information the King was
so delighted that he rewarded the man with a splendid
robe, and sent with him several attendants to bring
Farrukhzād to the palace.</p>

<p class='c009'>On arriving in his presence, Farrukhzād threw himself
at the King’s feet, but he raised him in his arms
and asked his forgiveness, and thus the affair ended in
rejoicing and festivity.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c009'>“Now,” said Bakhtyār, having concluded his story,
“it appears that women are expert in stratagems; and
if Farrukhzād had been put to death, according to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>King’s command, what grief and sorrow would have
been the consequence! To avoid such,” added
he, “let not your Majesty be precipitate in ordering
my execution.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The King resolved to wait another day, and Bakhtyār
was sent back to prison.</p>

</div>

<div class='c008'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/i_086.jpg' width='100' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
On the next morning, the Eighth Vizier, having
paid his compliments to the King, addressed
him on the subject of Bakhtyār, and said:
“Government resembles a tree, the root of which is
legal punishment. Now, if the root of a tree become
dry, the leaves will wither: why then should the punishment
of Bakhtyār be any longer deferred?”</p>

<p class='c009'>In consequence of this discourse, the King ordered
the executioner to prepare himself, and Bakhtyār was
brought from prison. When the unfortunate young
man came before the King, he addressed him, and
said: “If your Majesty will consider the consequences
of haste and precipitancy, it will appear that they are
invariably sorrow and repentance; as we find confirmed
in the Story of the Jewel-Merchant.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The King expressed his desire of hearing the story
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>to which he alluded; and Bakhtyār began it accordingly,
in the following manner:</p>

<h4 class='c020'>STORY OF THE JEWEL-MERCHANT.</h4>

<p class='c021'>There was a certain jewel-merchant, a very wealthy
man, and eminently skilled in the knowledge of precious
stones. His wife, a very prudent and amiable
woman, was in a state of pregnancy when it happened
that the King sent a messenger to her husband,
desiring his attendance at court, that he might consult
him in the choice of jewels. The merchant
received the King’s messenger with all due respect,
and immediately prepared to set out on his journey to
the capital. When taking leave of his wife, he desired
her to remember him in her prayers; and, in case
she should bring forth a boy, to call his name Bihrūz.</p>

<p class='c009'>After this injunction he departed from his house,
and at length arrived in the capital, where he waited
on the King, and having paid his respects, was employed
in selecting from a box of pearls those that
were most valuable. The King was so much pleased
with his skill and ingenuity, that he kept him constantly
near his own person, and entrusted to him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>the making of various royal ornaments, crowns, and
girdles studded with jewels.</p>

<p class='c009'>At length the wife of this jewel-merchant was delivered
of two boys; one of whom, in compliance with
her husband’s desire, she called Bihrūz, the other
Rūzbih; and she sent intelligence of this event to
the father, who solicited permission from the King
that he might return home for a while and visit his
family; but the King would not grant him this indulgence.
The next year he made the same request, and
with the same success. Thus during eight years he as
often solicited leave to visit his wife and sons, but
could not obtain it.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the course of this time the boys had learned to
read the Qur’ān, and were instructed in the art of
penmanship and other accomplishments; and they
wrote a letter to their father, expressing their sorrow
and anxiety on account of his absence. The jewel-merchant,
no longer able to resist his desire of seeing
his family, represented his situation to the King in
such strong colours that he desired him to send for his
wife and children, and allowed him an ample sum of
money to defray the expenses of their journey.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>A trusty messenger was immediately despatched to
the jewel-merchant’s wife, who, on receipt of her
husband’s letter, set out with her two sons on their
way to the capital. One evening, after a journey of
a month, they arrived at the sea-side. Here they
resolved to wait until morning; and, being refreshed
with a slight repast, the boys amused themselves in
wandering along the shore.</p>

<p class='c009'>It happened that the jewel-merchant, in expectation
of meeting his wife and children, had come thus far
on the way; and having left his clothes and money
concealed in different places, he bathed himself in
the sea, and on returning to the shore put on his
clothes, but forgot his gold. Having taken some
refreshment, he was proceeding on his journey, when
he thought of his money, and went back to seek it,
but could not find it. At this moment he perceived
the two boys, who had wandered thus far, amusing
themselves playing along the shore. He immediately
suspected that these boys had discovered and taken
the gold, and accused them accordingly. They declared
their ignorance of the matter, which so enraged
the jewel-merchant, that he seized them both, and cast
them headlong into the sea.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>After this he proceeded on his way; whilst the wife
was so unhappy at the long absence of her sons, that
the world became dark in her eyes, and she raised her
voice and called upon the boys. When the jewel-merchant
heard the voice of his wife, he hastened to meet
her, and inquired after his two sons, expressing his
eager desire of seeing them. The wife told him that
they had left her some time before, and had wandered
along the sea-side. At this intelligence the jewel-merchant
began to lament, and tore his clothes, and
exclaimed: “Alas, alas, I have drowned my sons!”
He then related what had happened, and proceeded
with his wife along the shore in search of the boys,
but they sought in vain. Then they smote their breasts
and wept. And when the next morning came, they
said: “From this time forth, whatsoever happens
must be to us a matter of indifference;” and they set
out on their journey towards the city, with afflicted
bosoms and bleeding hearts, being persuaded that
their sons had perished in the water.</p>

<p class='c009'>But they were ignorant of the wonderful kindness
of Providence, which rescued the two boys from destruction;
for it happened that the King of that
country, being on a hunting excursion, passed along
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>the shore on that side where Bihrūz had fallen. When
he perceived the boy, he ordered his attendants to
take him up, and finding him of a pleasing countenance,
although pale from the terror of the water and
the danger he had escaped, he inquired into the
circumstances which had befallen him. The boy
informed him, that with his brother he had been
walking on the shore, when a stranger seized upon
them, and flung them into the water. The King, not
having any child, inquired the name of the boy; and
when he answered, that his name was Bihrūz, he
exclaimed: “I accept it as a favourable omen,<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c014'><sup>[26]</sup></a> and
adopt you as my own son.” After this, Bihrūz,
mounted on a horse, accompanied the King to his
capital, and all the subjects were enjoined to obey
him as heir to the crown. After some time the King
died, and Bihrūz reigned in his place, with such wisdom,
liberality, and uprightness, that his fame resounded
through all quarters of the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>It happened in the meantime, that the other boy,
whose name was Rūzbih, had been rescued from the
water by some robbers, who agreed to sell him as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>slave, and divide the price amongst them. The jewel-merchant
and his wife had reached the city and purchased
a house, where they resolved to pass the
remainder of their lives in prayer and exercises of
devotion. But finding it necessary to procure an attendant,
the jewel-merchant purchased a young boy at
the slave-market, whom he did not know, but whom
natural affection prompted him to choose. On bringing
home the young slave, his wife fainted away, and
exclaimed: “This is your son Rūzbih!” The parents
as well as the child wept with joy, and returned thanks
to Heaven for such an unexpected blessing.</p>

<p class='c009'>After this the jewel-merchant instructed Rūzbih in
his own profession, so that in a little time he became
perfectly skilled in the value of precious stones; and
having collected a very considerable number, he expressed
a wish of turning them to profit, by selling
them to a certain King in a distant country, one who
was celebrated for his generosity and kindness to
strangers.</p>

<p class='c009'>The father consented that he should visit the court
of this monarch, on condition that he would not afflict
his parents by too long an absence. Rūzbih accordingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>set out, and arrived at the capital of that King,
who happened to be his own brother Bihrūz. Him,
however, after the lapse of many years, he did not
recognise. The King, having graciously received the
present which Rūzbih offered, purchased of him all
the jewels, and conceived such an affection for him
that he kept him constantly in the palace, day and
night.</p>

<p class='c009'>At this time a foreign enemy invaded the country;
but the King thought the matter of so little importance,
that he contented himself with sending some
troops to the field, and remained at home carousing
and drinking with Rūzbih. At length, one night, at a
very late hour, all the servants being absent, the King
became intoxicated, and fell asleep. Rūzbih, not
perceiving any of the guards or attendants, resolved
that he would watch the King until morning; and
accordingly, taking a sword, he stationed himself near
the King’s pillow.</p>

<p class='c009'>After some time had elapsed, several of the soldiers
who had gone to oppose the enemy returned, and,
entering the palace, discovered Rūzbih and the King
in this situation. They immediately seized Rūzbih;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>and when the King awoke, they told him that, by their
coming, they had saved his Majesty from assassination,
which the jeweller, with a drawn sword, had been
ready to perpetrate. The King, at first, ordered his
immediate execution; and as day was beginning to
dawn, and the approach of the enemy required his
presence at the head of his troops, he sent for the
executioner, who, having bound the eyes of Rūzbih
and drawn his sword, exclaimed: “Say, King of the
world, shall I strike or not?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The King, considering that it would be better to
inquire more particularly into the affair, and, knowing
that, although it is easy to kill, it is impossible to restore
a man to life, resolved to defer the punishment
until his return, and sent Rūzbih to prison.</p>

<p class='c009'>After this he proceeded to join the army, and having
subdued his enemies, returned to the capital; but,
during the space of two years, forgot the unfortunate
Rūzbih, who lingered away his life in confinement.
In the meantime his father and mother, grieving on
account of his absence, and, ignorant of what had befallen
him, sent a letter of inquiry by a confidential
messenger to the money-changers (or bankers) of that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>city. Having read this, they wrote back, in answer,
that Rūzbih had been in prison for two years.</p>

<p class='c009'>On receiving this information, the jewel-merchant
and his wife resolved to set out and throw themselves
at the feet of this King, and endeavour to obtain from
him the pardon and liberty of their son. With heavy
hearts they accordingly proceeded on their journey,
and having arrived at the capital, presented themselves
before the King, and said: “Be it known
unto your exalted Majesty, that we are two wretched
strangers, oppressed by the infirmities of age, and
overwhelmed by misfortune. We were blessed with
two sons, one named Bihrūz, the other Rūzbih; but
it was the will of Heaven that they should fall into
the sea, where one of them perished, but the other
was restored to us. The fame of your Majesty’s
generosity and greatness induced our son to visit this
imperial court; and we are informed that, by your
orders, he is now in prison. The object of our petition
is, that your Majesty might take compassion on
our helpless situation, and restore to us our long-lost
son.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The King on hearing this was astonished, and for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>a while imagined that it was all a dream. At length,
when convinced that the old man and woman were
his own parents, and that Rūzbih was his own brother,
he sent for him to the prison, embraced them and
wept, and placed them beside him on the throne;
and for the sake of Rūzbih, set at liberty all those
who had been confined with him. After this he
divided the empire with his brother, and their time
passed away in pleasure and tranquillity.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c009'>This story being concluded, Bakhtyār observed,
that the jewel-merchant, by his precipitancy, had
nearly occasioned the death of his two sons; and that
Bihrūz, by deferring the execution of his brother, had
prevented an infinity of distress to himself and his
parents. This observation induced the King to grant
Bakhtyār another day’s reprieve, and he was taken
back to prison.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
When the next morning came, the Ninth
Vizier appeared before the King and said,
that his extraordinary forbearance and lenity
in respect to Bakhtyār had given occasion to much
scandal; as every criminal, however heinous his offence,
began to think that he might escape punishment by
amusing the King with idle stories.</p>

<p class='c009'>The King, on hearing this, sent to the prison for
Bakhtyār, and desired the executioner to attend.
When the unfortunate young man came before the
King, he requested a respite only of two days, in
the course of which he hoped his innocence might be
proved; “although,” said he, “I know that the malice
of one’s enemies is a flame from which it is almost
impossible to escape: as appears from the story of
Abū Temām, who, on the strength of a false accusation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>was put to death by the King, and his innocence
acknowledged when too late.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who was that Abū Temām?” demanded the
King, “and what were those malicious accusations
which prevailed against him?”</p>

<h4 class='c020'>STORY OF ABŪ TEMĀM.</h4>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Abū Temām</span> (said Bakhtyār) was a very wealthy man,
who resided in a city, the King of which was so
tyrannical and unjust, that whatever money any one
possessed above five direms he seized on for his own
use. Abū Temām was so disgusted and terrified by
the oppressions and cruelties of this King, that he
never enjoyed one meal in peace or comfort, until
he had collected all his property together and contrived
to escape from that place. After some time he
settled in the capital of another King, a city adorned
with gardens, and well supplied with running streams.
This King was a man of upright and virtuous principles,
renowned for hospitality and kindness to
strangers. In this capital Abū Temām purchased a
magnificent mansion, in which he sumptuously entertained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>the people of the city, presenting each of them,
at his departure, with a handsome dress suited to his
rank. The inhabitants were delighted with his generosity,
and his hospitality was daily celebrated by the
strangers who resorted to his house. He also expended
considerable sums in the erection of bridges,
caravanseries, and mosques. At last the fame of his
liberality and munificence reached the King, who sent
to him two servants with a very flattering message
and an invitation to court. This Abū Temām thankfully
accepted; and having prepared the necessary
presents for the King, he hastened to the palace,
where he kissed the ground of obedience and was
graciously received.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a short time he became so great a favourite that
the King would not permit him to be one day absent,
and heaped on him so many favours that he was next
in power to his royal master; and his advice was followed
in all matters of importance.</p>

<p class='c009'>But this King had ten viziers, who conceived a
mortal hatred against Abū Temām, and said, one to
another: “He has robbed us of all dignity and
power, and we must devise some means whereby we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>may banish him from this country.” The chief vizier
proposed that, as the King was a very passionate
admirer of beauty, and the Princess of Turkestān one
of the loveliest creatures of the age, they should so
praise her charms before him as to induce him to
send Abū Temām to ask her in marriage; and as it
was the custom of the King of Turkestān to send all
ambassadors who came on that errand to his daughter,
who always caused their heads to be cut off, so the
destruction of Abū Temām would be certain.</p>

<p class='c009'>This advice all the other viziers approved of; and,
having proceeded to the palace, they took an opportunity
of talking on various subjects, until the King of
Turkestān was mentioned, when the chief vizier began
to celebrate the charms of the lovely Princess.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the King heard the extravagant praises of her
beauty, he became enamoured, and declared his intention
of despatching an ambassador to the court of
Turkestān, and demanding the Princess in marriage.
The viziers immediately said, that no person was so
properly qualified for such an embassy as Abū Temām.
The King accordingly sent for him, and, addressing
him as his father and friend, informed him that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>had now occasion for his assistance in the accomplishment
of a matter on which his heart was bent. Abū
Temām desired to know what his Majesty’s commands
might be, and declared himself ready to obey them.
The King having communicated his design, all the
necessary preparations were made, and Abū Temām
set out on his journey to the court of Turkestān. In
the meantime the viziers congratulated one another
on the success of their stratagem.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the King of Turkestān heard of Abū Temām’s
arrival, he sent proper officers to receive and compliment
him, and on the following day gave him a public
audience; and when the palace was cleared of the
crowd, and Abū Temām had an opportunity of speaking
with the King in private, he disclosed the object
of his mission, and demanded the Princess for his
master. The King acknowledged himself highly
honoured by the proposal of such an alliance, and
said: “I fear that my daughter is not qualified for so
exalted a station as you offer; but if you will visit her
in the harem, and converse with her, you may form
an opinion of her beauty and accomplishments; and
if you approve of her, preparations for the marriage
shall be made without delay.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>Abū Temām thanked his Majesty for this readiness
in complying with his demands; but said that he
could not think of profaning the beauty of her who
was destined for his sovereign by gazing on her, or of
allowing his ears to hear the forbidden sounds of her
voice;—besides, his King never entertained a doubt
on the subject of her charms and qualifications: the
daughter of such a monarch must be worthy of any
King, but he was not sent to make any inquiry as to
her merits, but to demand her in marriage.</p>

<p class='c009'>The King of Turkestān, on hearing this reply, embraced
Abū Temām, and said: “Within this hour I
meditated thy destruction; for of all the ambassadors
who have hitherto come to solicit my daughter, I have
tried the wisdom and talents, and have judged by
them of the Kings who employed them, and finding
them deficient, I have caused their heads to be cut
off.” On saying this, he took from under his robe a
key, with which he opened a lock, and going into
another part of the palace, he exhibited to Abū Temām
the heads of four hundred ambassadors.</p>

<p class='c009'>After this the King directed the necessary preparations
for the departure of his daughter, and invested
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Abū Temām with a splendid robe of honour, who,
when ten days had elapsed, embarked in a ship with
the Princess, her damsels, and other attendants. The
news of his arrival with the fair Princess of Turkestān
being announced, the King, his master, was delighted,
and the viziers, his mortal enemies, were confounded
at the failure of their stratagems. The King, accompanied
by all the people, great and small, went two
stages to meet Abū Temām and the Princess, and,
having led her into the city, after three days celebrated
their marriage by the most sumptuous feasts
and rejoicings, and bestowed a thousand thanks
on Abū Temām, who every day became a greater
favourite.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ten viziers, finding, in consequence of this, their
own importance and dignity gradually reduced, consulted
one with another, saying: “All that we have
hitherto done only tends to the exaltation of Abū
Temām; we must devise some other means of disgracing
him in the King’s esteem, and procuring his
banishment from this country.”</p>

<p class='c009'>After this they concerted together, and at length
resolved to bribe two boys, whose office was to rub
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>the King’s feet every night after he lay down on his
bed; and they accordingly instructed these boys to
take an opportunity, when the King should close his
eyes, of saying that Abū Temām had been ungrateful
for the favours bestowed on him; that he had violated
the harem, and aspired to the Queen’s affections, and
had boasted that she would not have come from
Turkestān had she not been enamoured of himself.
This lesson the viziers taught the boys, giving them a
thousand dīnars, and promising five hundred more.</p>

<p class='c009'>When it was night the boys were employed as usual
in their office of rubbing the King’s feet; and when
they perceived his eyes to be closed, they began to
repeat all that the viziers had taught them to say concerning
Abū Temām.</p>

<p class='c009'>The King, hearing this, started up, and dismissing
the boys, sent immediately for Abū Temām, and said
to him: “A certain matter has occurred, on the subject
of which I must consult you; and I expect that
you will relieve my mind by answering the question
that I shall ask.”—Abū Temām declared himself
ready to obey.—“What, then,” demanded the King,
“does that servant merit, who, in return for various
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>favours, ungratefully attempts to violate the harem of
his sovereign?”—“Such a servant,” answered Abū
Temām, “should be punished with death: his blood
should expiate his offence.” When Abū Temām had
said this, the King drew his scimitar, and cut off his
head, and ordered his body to be cast into a pit.</p>

<p class='c009'>For some days he gave not audience to any person,
and the viziers began to exult in the success of their
stratagem; but the King was melancholy, and loved
to sit alone, and was constantly thinking of the unfortunate
Abū Temām.</p>

<p class='c009'>It happened, however, that one day the two boys
who had been bribed by the viziers were engaged in a
dispute one with the other on the division of the
money, each claiming for himself the larger share.
In the course of their dispute they mentioned the
innocence of Abū Temām, and the bribe which they
had received for defaming him in the King’s hearing.</p>

<p class='c009'>All this conversation the King overheard; and
trembling with vexation, rage, and sorrow, he compelled
the boys to relate all the circumstances of the
affair; in consequence of which the ten viziers were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>immediately seized and put to death, and their houses
levelled with the ground; after which the King passed
his time in fruitless lamentation for the loss of Abū
Temām.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c009'>“Thus,” said Bakhtyār, “does unrelenting malice
persecute unto destruction; but if the King had not
been so hasty in killing Abū Temām, he would have
spared himself all his subsequent sorrow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The King, affected by this observation, resolved to
indulge Bakhtyār with another day, and accordingly
sent him back to prison.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER X.</h3>
</div>

<div class='c008'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/i_108.jpg' width='100' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
Early on the next morning the Tenth Vizier
sent a woman to the Queen with a message,
urging her to exert her influence over the
King, and induce him to give orders for the execution
of Bakhtyār. The Queen, in consequence of this,
addressed the King on the subject before he left the
palace, and he replied, that Bakhtyār’s fate was now
decided, and that his execution should not be any
longer deferred. The King then went forth, and the
Viziers attended in their proper places. The Tenth
Vizier was rising to speak, when the King informed
him of his resolution to terminate the affair of Bakhtyār
by putting him to death on that day.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was brought accordingly from the prison; and
the King on seeing him said: “You have spoken a
great deal of your innocence, yet have not been able
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>to make it appear; therefore no longer entertain any
hopes of mercy, for I have given orders for your execution.”—On
hearing this, Bakhtyār began to weep,
and said: “I have hitherto endeavoured to gain time,
conscious of my innocence, and hoping that it might
be proved, and a guiltless person saved from an ignominious
death; but I now find it vain to struggle
against the decrees of Heaven. Thus the King of
Persia foolishly attempted to counteract his destiny,
and triumph over the will of Providence, but in vain.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The King expressed a desire of hearing the story
to which Bakhtyār alluded, and the young man began
to relate it as follows:</p>

<h4 class='c020'>STORY OF THE KING OF PERSIA.</h4>

<p class='c021'>There was a certain King of Persia, a very powerful
and wealthy monarch, who, not having any child, employed
all the influence of prayers and of alms to
procure the blessing of a son from Heaven. At
length one of his handmaids became pregnant, and
the King was transported with joy; but one night, in
a dream, he was addressed by an old man, who said:
“The Lord has complied with your request, and to-morrow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>you shall have a son; but in his seventh year
a lion shall seize and carry off this son to the top of a
mountain, from which he shall fall, rolling in blood
and clay.” When the King awoke, he assembled the
viziers, and related to them the horrors of his dream.
They replied: “Long be the King’s life! If Heaven
has decreed such a calamity who can oppose or control
it?”—The King presumptuously declared that he
would struggle against and counteract it; but one of
his viziers, eminently skilled in astrology, discovered
one day, by the power of his science, that the King
would, after twenty years, perish by the hand of his
own son. In consequence of this, he immediately
waited on the King, and informed him that he had to
communicate a certain matter, for the truth and certainty
of which he would answer with his life. The
King desired him to reveal it; and he, falling on the
knees of obedience, related all that he had discovered
in the stars. “If it happens not according to what
you predict,” said the King, “I shall certainly put
you to death.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In the meantime, however, he caused a subterraneous
dwelling to be constructed, to which he sent
the boy, with a nurse. There they remained during
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>the space of seven years, when, in compliance with the
heavenly decree, a lion suddenly rushed into the cave,
and devoured the nurse, and having wounded the
child, carried him up to the summit of a neighbouring
mountain, from which he let him fall to the bottom,
covered with blood and earth. It happened that one
of the King’s secretaries came by, in pursuit of game,
and perceived the boy in this situation, and the lion
standing on the summit of the mountain. He immediately
resolved to save the child; and having
taken him to his own house, he healed his wounds,
and instructed him in various accomplishments.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the day after the nurse had been devoured and
the child carried away by the lion, the King resolved
to visit the cave, and finding it deserted, he concluded
that the nurse had escaped to some other place. He
instantly despatched messengers to seek her in every
quarter, but in vain.</p>

<p class='c009'>In process of time the boy grew up, and acted as
keeper [of pen and ink] to the secretary. In this
situation, having been employed at the palace, it
happened that the King saw and was much pleased
with him, and felt within his bosom the force of paternal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>affection. In consequence of this he demanded
him of the secretary, and clothed him in splendid
garments; and after some time, when an enemy invaded
the country, and required the King’s presence
with his army, he appointed the young man to be his
armour-bearer; and, accompanied by him, proceeded
to battle.</p>

<p class='c009'>After a bloody conflict, the troops of the enemy
were victorious, and those of the King began to fly;
but he, in the impulse of rage and fury, threw himself
into the midst of his adversaries, fighting with the
most desperate valour. In this state of confusion it
was impossible to know one person from another; the
young armour-bearer, who fought also with the utmost
bravery, no longer distinguishing the King, rushed
into a crowd of combatants, and striking furiously on
all sides, cut off the hand of one man whom he supposed
to be of the enemy’s side; but this person was
the King, who, on recognising the armour-bearer,
upbraided him with this attempt upon his life, and
being unable to remain any longer in the field, he
retired, with his troops, to the capital, and the next
day concluded a peace with the enemy, on condition
of paying a considerable sum of money. He then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>gave orders that the armour-bearer should be arrested,
and although he persevered in declarations of innocence,
they availed him not; he was thrown into
prison, and loaded with chains.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the meantime the King was reposing on the
pillow of death; and when he found that all hopes
of recovery were vain, he resolved to punish the
vizier who had told him that his son should be torn
by a lion, and that he should fall by the hand of that
son. “Now,” said the King, “my son has been
carried away to some other country by his nurse, and
I have been wounded by the hand of a different person.”
Having said this, he sent for the vizier, and
desired him to prepare for death. “This armour-bearer,”
added he, “and not my own son, has wounded
me, contrary to your prediction; and, as you consented
to be punished in case your prediction should not be
accomplished, I have resolved to put you to death.”—“Be
it so,” replied the vizier; “but let us first inquire
into the birth of this young armour-bearer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The King immediately sent for the young man, and
asked him concerning his parents and his country.
He answered that of the country which gave him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>birth he was ignorant; but that he had been with his
mother in a subterraneous place, and that she had informed
him of his father’s being a king, but he had
never seen his father; that one day a lion carried him
away to the summit of a mountain, from which he fell,
and was taken up by the secretary, by whom he
was instructed in various accomplishments, and from
whose service he passed into that of the King.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the King heard this, he was amazed, and
his hair stood on end; and he sent for the viziers
and secretary, who confirmed what the young man
had said.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having thus ascertained that the armour-bearer was
his own son, he resigned to him the crown and throne;
and having invested the vizier with the robe of prime-minister,
he expired in the course of three days.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c009'>Here Bakhtyār concluded his narrative, and observed,
that he had struggled against his evil destiny,
like that king, but in vain. Having said this, the
King wished to send him back to prison; but the Ten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>Viziers unanimously declared that they would leave
the country if Bakhtyār’s punishment was any longer
deferred.</p>

<p class='c009'>The King then acknowledged that he could not
bear to behold the execution of the young man; in
consequence of which the Viziers led him away, and
assembled all the people by proclamation, that they
might see him put to death.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CONCLUSION.</h3>
</div>

<div class='c008'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/i_116.jpg' width='100' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
It happened at this time that Farrukhsuwār, who
had found Bakhtyār at the side of the well,
came, with some of his companions, to the
city, and was wrapped in that embroidered cloak
which the King and Queen had left with the infant.
In passing by the place of execution he beheld the
guards leading out Bakhtyār to punishment, on which
he rushed amongst them with his companions, and
rescued the young man from their hands, and then
solicited an audience of the King.</p>

<p class='c009'>On coming into the royal presence Farrukhsuwār
exclaimed: “This young man is my son; I cannot
bear to see him executed: if he must perish, let me
also be put to death.”—“Your wish in this respect,”
said the King, “may be easily gratified.”—“Alas!”
cried Farrukhsuwār, “if the father of this youth, who
was a king, or his mother, who was a queen, were informed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>of his situation, they would save him from
this ignominious death!” The King laughed at the
seeming inconsistency of Farrukhsuwār, and said:
“You told me at one time that Bakhtyār was your
son, yet now you describe him as the child of royal
parents.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Farrukhsuwār, in reply, told all the circumstances
of his finding Bakhtyār near the well, and showed the
cloak in which he had been wrapped. The King
immediately knew it to be the same which he had
left with the infant, and asked whether Farrukhsuwār
had found anything besides. He produced the bracelet
of pearls, and the King, now convinced that
Bakhtyār was not the son of Farrukhsuwār, but his
own, took the cloak and the bracelets to the Queen,
and asked her if she had ever before seen them. She
instantly exclaimed: “They were my child’s!—what
tidings do you bring of him?”—“I shall bring himself,”
replied the King; and he immediately sent an
order to the Viziers that they should conduct Bakhtyār
to the palace.</p>

<p class='c009'>When he arrived, the King, with his own hands,
took off his chains, placed a royal turban on his head,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>and covered him with the embroidered cloak, and
then led him to the Queen, saying: “This is our son,
whom we left on the brink of the well.” When the
Queen heard this, and beheld Bakhtyār, the tears
gushed forth from her eyes, and she embraced him
with the greatest emotion. Bakhtyār then asked
the Queen why she had endeavoured to destroy him
by a false accusation, and she confessed that the Viziers
had induced her; on which the King ordered their immediate
execution, and then resigned the throne to
Bakhtyār, who was acknowledged sovereign by all the
people. Farrukhsuwār was invested with the dignity
of chief Vizier, and his companions rewarded with
honourable appointments; and Bakhtyār continued
for many years to govern with justice, wisdom, and
generosity.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>⁂ In the Preface to his translation and text of the <cite>Bakhtyār
Nāma</cite>, Sir William Ouseley states, that “as this work is chiefly
designed for the use of those who begin to study the Persian
language,” he selected for translation, from among three manuscripts
in his own possession and five or six others in the collections
of several friends, “that which seemed written in the most
pure and simple style; for several copies, in passing through the
hands of ignorant or conceited transcribers, have suffered a
considerable depravation of the original text, and one, in particular,
is so disguised by the alterations and augmented by the
additions of some Indian Munshī, that it appears almost a different
work. These additions, however, are only turgid amplifications
and florid exuberancies, according to the modern corrupt style of
Hindūstān, which distinguishes the compositions of that country
from the chaste and classical productions of Īrān.” Regarding
his own translation, he says that, while it will be found sufficiently
literal, he has “not retained those idioms which would
not only be uncouth, but perhaps unintelligible, in English:
some repetitions I have taken the liberty of omitting; and as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>most of the stories begin and end nearly in the same manner,
I have on such occasions compressed into a few lines the subject
of a page.” But since the translation was mainly designed to aid
learners of Persian, it seems strange that he should have deemed
it advisable to take any “liberties” such as he mentions; and
an examination of the text appended to his translation shows that
he has occasionally done something more than omit mere “repetitions”:
in several instances he has omitted whole passages,
of which many are requisite to the proper connection of the
incidents related in the stories; and this, too, in dealing with a
text which is itself evidently abridged from “the original”—if
indeed an original Persian text now exists.</p>

<p class='c009'>The more important deficiencies of Sir William Ouseley’s
translation—arising, as has been already explained, from his
imperfect text as well as from his own omissions—which will
be found included in the following Notes, have been supplied by
my obliging friend Mr William Platt, the veteran scholar, who
has taken the trouble of comparing the translation with the
carefully edited lithographed text of the <cite>Bakhtyār Nāma</cite>, published,
at Paris, in 1839; and has, besides these notes of omissions,
&amp;c., kindly furnished me with other valuable materials,
of which I have gladly availed myself, with the view of rendering
this curious and in many respects unique work more complete
and interesting to general English readers.</p>

  <h3 class='c023'><span class='sc'>Notes on Chapter I.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c021'>It is customary for Muslim authors to place at the beginning
of all their compositions the Arabic invocation—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>bi ’smi ’llāhi ’r-rahmānī ’r-rahīmī</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>which Sale renders: “In the name of the most merciful God!”
but which is more correctly translated: “In the name of God,
the Merciful, the Compassionate!” The <em>`Ulama</em>, or professors
of religion and law, interpret “the merciful” to signify “merciful
in small things,” and “the compassionate,” as “merciful in
great things.” This invocation, which is placed at the head of
each chapter of the Kur’ān, except the ninth, is not only also
prefixed to every Muhammadan book or writing, but is pronounced
by Muslims on their undertaking every lawful act. It
is said that Muhammad borrowed it from a similar practice of
the Magians and Rabbins. Following the invocation are usually
praise and blessings on the Prophet, his Family, and his Companions.
In Sir William Ouseley’s printed text only the customary
invocation appears, which he does not give in his English
version. The following is a translation of the introduction as
given in the lithographed text:</p>

<blockquote>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>“In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate!</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Thanksgiving and praise without end, and salutation and eulogium
without stint, to the Supreme Benefactor, who is above all
commendation—the Holy-One, beyond our imagination! May
He be ever exalted on high, the well-furnished table of whose
generosity is spread over the surface of the earth, and on the

Drangiana), lies to the east of Farsistān, or Persia proper. The
Governor is entitled Shah-i-nīmrūz (Sa`dī’s <cite>Gulistān</cite>, iii, 27).
The famous Rustam, the Hercules of Persia, held this country as
a fief under the Kings of Persia (see Ranking’s <cite>Wars and Sports

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_3'>3</a>.</em> Sipah-sālār, here employed as a proper name, signifies
a general, a commander of an army, especially a chief of cavalry:
from asp, a horse, and <em>sālār</em>, a leader. <cite>Sālār-i-jung</cite>, a leader
in war, is one of the titles given by Eastern princes to their
nobles.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_3'>3</a>.</em> “The rose of the garden and the moon of the heavenly
spheres were confounded at the superior lustre of her cheeks.”—The
comparison of a beautiful woman’s face to the moon, however
absurd it may appear to some readers, is a very favourite
one with Orientals, from Solomon downwards; it is, moreover,
employed by several of our own admired English poets, as
Spenser, Shakspeare, and Pope. In the Notes to my <cite>Arabian
Poetry for English Readers</cite> many parallel passages on this similitude
are cited from Eastern and Western poets.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_4'>4</a>.</em> “A litter was provided.”—Several kinds of litters are
used in Persia and India. Garcin de Tassy, in a note to his
French translation of the Persian romance of <cite>Kāmarupa</cite> (chap.
xxiii), quotes the following interesting account of the palanquins
and carriages of India, from the <cite>Arāish-i-Mahfil</cite>:</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is known that the <em>gāri</em> is an invention of the people of
India. They who use them are sheltered from heat, cold, wind,
or rain. The Bayadīres [or dancing-girls], who employ these
carriages drawn by oxen, put silver ornaments on their horns,
hang small bells on the axle-tree, and place negroes on the pole.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>In this sumptuous carriage they frequent fairs, the shrines visited
by pilgrims, and public gardens. The astonished lookers-on are
inclined to regard them as strolling fairies, travelling on thrones
to the sound of cymbals;&nbsp;... but the carriages of discreet
females, named <em>rath</em>, are covered with awnings, so closely fastened
that the opening of the breadth of a hair cannot be seen.
Unfortunately the wheeled carriages jolt, yet in other respects
are comfortable. Three or four men seated can travel without
fatigue, chatting the meanwhile, and perform the journey, enjoying
the advantage of repose. Some of the <em>gāri</em> have curtains,
some are without. The small and light are called <em>manjhalī</em>,
the very light and diminutive, <em>gainī</em>, and the oxen drawing
them are of a peculiarly small breed, and are distinguished by
the name of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gaina</span></i>. These small carriages are preferable to the
<em>rath</em>, which has four wheels. In fact, they jolt but little, and
are of sufficient importance to carry the Amīr. There are some
so well constructed, and adorned with such beautiful paintings,
that they throw into a frenzy those who behold them; and
the blinds are to such a degree pleasing and elegant that, if the
Sun shone as they were passing along, he would descend from
his car and mount thereon; and if the god Indra [King of
Heaven] should see them, he would quit his throne and place
himself therein. So that persons of high rank, who do not disdain
to use them, vary the furniture according to the seasons:
during hot weather the blinds are made of veti-ver;<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c014'><sup>[27]</sup></a> in the rainy
season, of oiled silk; and in winter, of wool. Those, however,
who use them most frequently are traders, bankers, government
servants, and Muslim and Hindū women.—Besides the
carriages just described there is a kind of throne, called <em>nālkī</em>, for
sovereigns; and for the Amīr, palanquins with trimmings of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>fringe, termed <em>pālkī</em>. The palanquins of ladies are the <em>mahādol</em>,
<em>chāndol</em>, <em>sukhpūl</em>, and <em>miāna</em>; and for the female poor, <em>dolī</em>.
So that a lady, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">comme il faut</span></i>, need never walk, and no individual
who is not <em>mahram</em> [who is not privileged to visit the
harem] can ever see her figure.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Among the other kinds of litters or carriages used in the East
are: the <em>imari</em>, carried by elephants and camels, so named from
Imar, the inventor, also called <em>hodaj</em>, or <em>hawdaj</em> (howdah),
made of wood, or cloth stretched over a frame, and either open
or covered at the top; and the <em>takht-i-ravan</em>, usually carried
by mules within shafts before and behind: it is the Armamaxa,
in which the children of Darius and their attendants were
carried. (<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quintus Curtius</span></cite>, b. iii, c. 3.)</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_4'>4</a>.</em> “The King&nbsp;... was at that moment returning
from the chase.”—Hunting the antelope, wild-ass, &amp;c., has been
the favourite pastime of the kings and nobles of Persia from the
most ancient times. The modern kings of Persia have palaces
in many parts of their dominions, whither they resort for the
climate or for the chase. To these palaces are attached villages,
in which provisions are collected for the use of the court as
soon as the motions of the King are decided.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c014'><sup>[28]</sup></a>—For a graphic
description of the Persian mode of hunting the antelope, with
hawks as well as dogs, see Sir John Malcolm’s <cite>Sketches of Persia</cite>.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_4'>4</a>.</em> “Kissed the ground of respectful obedience.”—The
Persians in their salutations and acts of submission so prostrate
themselves as almost to place their faces on the ground. This
prostration, called <em>rūy zamīn</em> (“the face on the ground”), is
made by bowing the body at right angles, the hands placed on
the knees, and the legs a little apart.—In allusion to this mode
of salutation, the Persian poet Hāfiz declares that, in the presence
of his fair enslaver, he would <em>make besoms of his eyelashes</em>; as
Richardson paraphrases it:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>O for one heavenly glance of that dear maid,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>How would my raptured heart with joy rebound!</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Lane, in the Notes to his translation of the <cite>Thousand and One
Nights</cite>, thus describes the Arabian (or modern Egyptian) mode
of paying respect to superiors: touching the ground, and then
the lips and forehead, or turban, with the right hand.—The
Khalif Hakim Biamri ’llah (11th century) issued an order that
no one in future should kiss the ground in his presence, or salute
him in the highway, or kiss his hand or stirrup; because to prostrate
oneself before a human being was an act of worship
introduced by the Greeks; and the only formula of salutation
should be: “May protection be vouchsafed to the Prince of the
Faithful! May the mercy and blessings of God rest upon him!”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_5'>5</a>.</em> “Fixed by the fascinating beauty of the damsel,”
&amp;c.—The lithographed text says: “From the effect of her
glance the heart became lost, and the bird of his soul began to
take flight in the atmosphere of love.... He pushed forward
his courser, and recited this <i><span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">gazal</span></i> [or ode]:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_5'>5</a>.</em> “Ruler of the world.” The text gives the address
of the litter-attendants to the King as follows:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whatever may be the advice of the Pādishāh who adorns the
world, it is the eye [<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i> the essence] of correct judgment.</p>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>O mighty King of the chief city,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy counsel is always good;</div>
      <div class='line'>How can any one oppose thy command—</div>
      <div class='line'>Who would dare to express himself otherwise?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Thy command [will be] the support of the life and the happiness
of the father and the daughter. If they had seen in a dream
this happiness, they would not be able to contain themselves
in this world, especially in a state of wakefulness. But for every
transaction there is custom and propriety, [so that] if they [<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i> the
litter attendants] escort at this moment the daughter to the city,
people will raise doubts, and foster a suspicion touching the
King, [on the score] of undue haste and impatience, and will
assert that the King had carried off this lady by force and abuse
of power, and [thus] would arise [tittle-tattle respecting] the
question and answer of the lovers, and the exulting triumph<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c014'><sup>[30]</sup></a>
of the enemies. This is the right course to pursue: if the King
grant permission, we will convoy the daughter to Sipahsālār,
that he may do for this discharge of duty whatever is the custom;
and, having provided suitable paraphernalia, send back the
daughter to the Pādishāh; and thus both the vizier’s dignity
would be maintained, and also the [love] affair of the Pādishāh
be accomplished in a becoming manner.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The giving of a dowry is indispensable, and without it no marriage
is legal. According to the rank in life of the bride, it
consists of a wardrobe, jewels, furniture, slaves, eunuchs, and a
sum of money varying in amount. No portion of the dowry can
be taken away by the husband against the wife’s wish. She
remains absolute mistress of the whole of her own property,
inherited, or otherwise acquired. (<cite>Voyages de M. Chardin en
Perse, &amp;c.; Lane’s Modern Egyptians.</cite>)</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span><em>Page <a href='#Page_6'>6</a>.</em> “He caused the necessary ceremonies to be performed.”—Here
again the text is fuller than our translation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class='c009'>“And the marriage-knot was tied in strict conformity with
the law. And when the ceremony was concluded, all the
secretaries of the government wrote letters of congratulation,
and apprised Sipahsālār of the submission to this insult. When
Sipahsālār read the letters a flood of tears poured down from
his eyes, and the fire of enmity kindled a flame in his heart.
And although the King had settled the matter religiously and
according to the law, yet when all that had transpired reached
his ears, his heart bled to overflowing, by reason of the excess of
affection for his daughter. Sipahsālār, considering it good policy,
wrote a letter of thanks to his Excellency the Pādishāh, replete
with all kinds of expressions, evincing joy and felicity: ‘This is
indeed happiness, that such powerful support should be extended
towards me! I am utterly unable to quit myself of the obligation
I am under for this high honour, now that his Majesty has placed
this crown of glory on the head of his slave. As soon as I arrive
in the royal presence, I will kiss the ground of felicity.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dissembling, he penned these phrases, and concealed the
[evil] intention of his wrath, and day and night was devising
deceit and stratagem.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class='c009'>The Vizier of Āzādbakht could ill brook his rights as a father
being set at naught. The parent, or nearest adult relation, is
always the deputy of the future bride to effect the marriage
contract. Moreover, Sipahsālār considered this tyrannical proceeding
as an ungrateful return for his services with the army.
Notwithstanding the King’s rather brusque manner of wooing,
however, the lady is represented as being devotedly attached to
him, and she braved the perils of the desert for his sake.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_8'>8</a>.</em> “To seek an asylum from the King of Kirmān.”—The

<p class='c009'>Kirmān (Carmania) is a province of Persia (the ancient Gedrasia),
having to the north Khurasan, to the east Afghanistān
and Bilūchistān, to the south the Persian Gulf, to the west Fars
and Luristān. <em>Carmanicus Sinus</em>: the Gulf of Ormuz. Kirmān
is the plural of <em>kirm</em>, a worm, and the province where silkworms
were originally bred. It is celebrated for the cultivation
of the white rose, from which <em>`itr-i-gul</em> (attar of roses) is distilled;
and also for a peculiar breed of sheep, called <em>dumbadār</em>, small,
short-legged, with a long bushy tail.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_9'>9</a>.</em> “A hundred thousand lives such as mine are not in
value equal to a single hair of the King’s head.”—In less extravagant
terms does a distressed damsel in another romance express
herself: “Of a truth, noble man, you have displayed your compassionate
nature; but I cannot consent to save my body at the
cost of yours: for who ought to save a common stone by the
sacrifice of a gem?”—<cite>Vetāla Panchavinsati</cite>, or Twenty-five
Tales of a Demon.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_10'>10</a>.</em> “The Queen brought forth a son; in beauty he
was lovely as the moon,” &amp;c.—The Orientals compare beautiful
youths, as well as damsels, to the moon: Hafiz styles
Joseph the Hebrew patriarch—who is throughout the Muhammadan
world regarded as the type of youthful beauty—“the
Moon of Canaan.” Morier remarks, in his <cite>Second Journey to
Persia, &amp;c.</cite>: “The Eastern women suffer little from parturition,
for the better sort of them are frequently on foot the day after
delivery, and out of all confinement on the third day [this on
the authority of Harmer, vol. iv, p. 434]. They are sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>‘delivered ere the midwives come in unto them’: Exodus, i, 19;
and the lower orders often deliver themselves. I knew an instance
where a peasant’s wife, in Turkey, who was at work in a
vineyard, stepped behind the hedge, delivered herself, and carried
the child home slung behind her back.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_10'>10</a>.</em> “They wrapped up the child in a cloak embroidered
with gold, and fastened a bracelet of large pearls,” &amp;c.—In
the legend of Pope Gregory, the child is exposed with gold at
his head and silver at his feet (see the English <cite>Gesta Romanorum</cite>,
chapter 51; edited by Herrtage); and in one of the Tales of the
<cite>Vetāla</cite>, a child is similarly exposed, with a sum of gold, at the
gate of a royal palace, and the King adopts him as his son and
successor (<cite>Kathā Sarit Sāgara</cite>, Ocean of the Rivers of Narrative).</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_10'>10</a>.</em> “He sent his servants to welcome them, and
received them with the greatest respect and hospitality;” that
is, by a deputation (<em>istikbāl</em>), one of the principal modes among
the Persians of doing honour to their guests. Those sent in
advance to meet the guests are called <em>pīsh vāz</em>, “openers of the
way.” In the ninth chapter we find the approaching guests met
at the distance of two days’ journey<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c014'><sup>[31]</sup></a> from the city. “On the
day of our entry,” says Morier, in his <cite>Second Journey</cite>, “we were
met by the youngest son of the Amīnu-’d-Dawla, a boy of about
thirteen years of age, who received the ambassador [Sir Gore
Ouseley] with all the ease of an old courtier.” So, too, the
King of Kirmān “sent his own son and two attendants to
wait on Āzādbakht.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_11'>11</a>.</em> “The musicians singing and playing, and the
guests drinking.”—Music contributes as much as wine to the
pleasures of an Eastern carousal. “Wine,” they say, “is as
the body, music is the soul, and joy is their offspring.” The
gamut, or scale of musical notes, is called in the East, <em>durr-imafassal</em>,
“separate pearls.” The musical instruments commonly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>employed are: the <em>Kānūn</em>, the dulcimer or harp; the
<em>sitār</em>, a three-stringed instrument (from <em>si</em>, three, and <em>tār</em>, string),
whence cithara and guitar; and the <em>arghān</em> or <em>orghanūn</em>, the
organ. Old Persian writers describe the <em>arghān</em> as invented by
<em>Iflatūn</em> (Plato), and as superior to all psalteries (<em>mazamīr</em>), and
used in Yūnan (Ionia or Greece) and in Rūm (Iconium). Also
the <em>chang</em> (Arabic, <em>junk</em>), the harp; the <em>rabāb</em>, rebeck; the
<em>tambūr</em>, tambourine; and the <em>barbat</em>, or barbitan.—Morier, in
his Second Journey (p. 92), was treated with a concert of four
musicians; “one of whom played on the <em>Kamāncha</em> [viol];
a second sang, fanning his mouth with a piece of paper to aid
the undulations of his voice; the third was a tambourine-player;
and the last beat two little drums placed on the ground before
him.” Gentius, in a note to the <cite>Gulistān</cite> of Sa`dī, says that
“music is in such consideration [in Persia], that it is a maxim of
their sages, that when a king is about to die, if he leaves for his
successor a very young son, his aptitude for reigning should be
proved by some agreeable songs; and if the child is pleasurably
affected, then it is a sign of his capacity and genius, but if
the contrary, he should be declared unfit.”—It would appear
that the old Persian musicians, like Timotheus, know the secret
art of swaying the passions. The celebrated philosopher Alfarabi
(who died about the middle of the tenth century), among his
other accomplishments, excelled in music, in proof of which a
curious anecdote is told.  Returning from the pilgrimage to
Mecca, he introduced himself, though a stranger, at the court of
Sayfu-’d-Dawla, Sultan of Syria, when a party of musicians chanced
to be performing, and he joined them.  The prince admired his
skill, and desiring to hear something of his own, Alfarabi unfolded
a composition, and distributed the parts among the band.
The first movement threw the prince and his courtiers into violent
and inextinguishable laughter, the next melted all into tears, and
the last lulled even the performers to sleep.—At the retaking of
Bagdād by the Turks, in 1638, when the springing of a mine,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>whereby eight hundred janissaries perished, was the signal for a
general massacre, and thirty thousand Persians were put to the
sword, “a Persian musician, named Shāh Kūlī, who was brought
before Murād, played and sang so sweetly, first a song of triumph,
and then a dirge, that the Sultan, moved to pity by his
music, gave orders to stop the massacre.”<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c014'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_11'>11</a>.</em> “His eyes were filled with tears.”—Although
Muslims are remarkably calm and resigned under the heaviest
afflictions, yet they do not consider the shedding of tears as
either evidence of effeminacy or inconsistent with a heroic mind.—<em>Lane.</em>
In the old Badawī <cite>Romance of `Antar</cite> (of which an
epitome is given in my <cite>Arabian Poetry for English Readers</cite>)
the hero is frequently represented as weeping.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_11'>11</a>.</em> “The King of Kirmān then inquired into the particulars
of Āzādbakht’s misfortunes.”—It thus appears that, in
accordance with the time-honoured rules of Eastern hospitality,
the King received Āzādbakht as his guest without subjecting him
to any preliminary questioning; and only diffidently “inquired
into the particulars” after the unhappy monarch had informed
him that he was a fugitive from his kingdom. The old Arabs,
like the old Scottish Highlanders, were scrupulous in abstaining
from inquiring the name and tribe of a chance guest, lest he
should prove an enemy; and if, after the guest had eaten of
their bread and salt, he was found to belong to a hostile tribe or
clan, he would be entertained during three days, should he so
desire, and then be dismissed unharmed.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_12'>12</a>.</em> Farrukhsuwār: from <em>farrukh</em>, fortunate, happy, and
<em>suwār</em>, a cavalier, a horseman; especially a Persian chief, as
being skilled in horsemanship and archery. Suwār-i-Sīstān:
Rustam, the famous Persian hero.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span><em>Page <a href='#Page_13'>13</a>.</em> “He resolved to adopt the infant as his own.”—The
Muhammadan law (says Lane) allows the adoption of sons,
provided that the person to be adopted consents to the act, if of
age to judge for himself; also that he has been deprived of his
parents by death or other means; and that there be such a difference
of age between the two parties as might subsist between a
natural father and son. The adopted son enjoys the same right
of inheritance as the natural son.—Farrukhsuwār, we see, though
a chief of banditti, yet took care that his adopted son should be
“instructed in all the necessary accomplishments.” The adoption
of sons is universal throughout the East—in Persia, India,
Japan; in the latter country, “the principle of adoption,” says
Mr Mitford, in his <cite>Tales of Old Japan</cite>, “prevails among all
classes, from the Emperor down to his meanest subject; nor is
the family line considered to have been broken because an
adopted son has succeeded to the estate.”</p>

Theodore.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_13'>13</a>.</em> “Able to fight, alone, five hundred men.” This
is one of the few instances of Oriental hyperbole which occur
in the work; and since we do not find our hero represented
subsequently as distinguishing himself by his prowess, except on
the occasion which led to his capture, it must be considered as
introduced by the author conventionally, or by way of embellishment.
The heroes of Eastern romance, for the most part, are
not only beautiful as the moon, and accomplished in all the arts
and sciences, but also strong and courageous as a lion. In the
romance of <cite>Dūshwanta and Sakūntalā</cite>, an episode of the great
Indian epic poem, <cite>Mahābharata</cite>, the son of the beautiful
heroine is thus described: “Sakūntalā was delivered of a son,
of inconceivable strength, bright as the God of Fire, the image
of Dūshwanta, endowed with personal beauty and generosity of
soul.... This mighty child seemed as if he could destroy lions
with the points of his white teeth. He bore on his hand the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>mark of a wheel, which is the sign of sovereignty. His person
was beautiful, his head capacious, he possessed great bodily
strength, and his appearance was that of a celestial. During
the short time that he remained under the care of Kanwa, he
grew exceedingly; and when he was only six years old, his
strength was so great that he was wont to bind such beasts as
lions, tigers, elephants, wild boars, and buffaloes to the trees
about the hermitage. He would even mount them, ride them
about, and play with them to tame them; whence the inhabitants
of Kanwa’s hermitage gave him a name: ‘Let him,’ said they,
‘be called Sarva-damana, because he tameth all;’ and thus the
child obtained the name of Sarva-damana.”—And the Arabian
hero `Antar, while yet a mere stripling, slew a wolf, and carried
home its paws to his slave-mother as a trophy. (Compare with
this the youthful exploit of David with a lion and a bear, 1 Sam.
xvii, 34, 35.) So, too, in the Early English Romance of Sir
Bevis of Hampton;—when only seven years old, Bevis knocked
down two stout men with his cudgel; and while still in his
“teens” he slew single-handed sixty Saracen knights.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_14'>14</a>.</em> “The chief of the caravan.”—The <em>Mihtar Kārwān</em>,

dress of honour, is bestowed by Eastern monarchs on men of
learning and genius, as well as on tributary princes on their
accession to their principalities, and on viceroys and governors
of provinces. The custom is very ancient; see Esther vi, 8, 9.
“A common <em>Khil`at</em>,” says Morier, “consists of a Kāba, or coat;
a <em>Kemerbend</em>, or zone; a <em>gūch pīch</em>, or shawl for the head:
when it is intended to be more distinguishing, a sword or a
dagger is superadded. To persons of distinction rich furs are
given, such as a <em>Katabī</em>, or a <em>Koordī</em>; but when the <em>Khal`at</em>
is complete it consists exactly of the same articles as the present
which Cyrus made to Syennesis, namely: a horse with a golden
bridle; a golden chain; a golden sword<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c014'><sup>[33]</sup></a>; besides the dress,
which is complete in all its parts.”<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c014'><sup>[34]</sup></a>—In India an elephant and

(Garden and Spring), the Hindustani version of the entertaining
Persian romance, <cite>Kissa Chehar Dervish</cite>, or Tale of the Four
Dervishes, remarks that “in the zenith of the Mogul empire
Khil`ats were expensive honours, as the receivers were obliged
to make presents for the Khil`ats they received. The perfection
of these Oriental dresses,” he adds, “is to be so stiff with embroidery
as to stand on the floor unsupported.”—After Rustam’s
Seven Adventures in releasing Kai Kaus from the power of the
White Giant, we read in Firdausī’s <cite>Shāh Nāma</cite> (or Book of
Kings) that he received from Kaus a splendid Khil`at besides
other magnificent presents. And in the <cite>Romance of `Antar</cite>,
King Zuhayr causes a great feast to be prepared to celebrate the
defeat of the tribe of Taï, which was chiefly due to the hero; at
which he presents `Antar with a robe worked with gold, girds on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>him a trusty sword, and placing in his hand a pike of Khāta, and
mounting him on a fine Arab horse, proclaims him champion of
the tribes of `Abs and `Adnān.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_16'>16</a>.</em> “There were Ten Viziers.”—“Wezeer,” says Lane,
“is an Arabic word, and is pronounced by the Arabs as I have
written it, but the Turks and Persians pronounce the first letter
<em>V</em>. There are three opinions respecting the etymology of this
word. Some derive it from <em>wizr</em> (a burden), because the Wezeer
bears the burden of the King; others, from <em>wezer</em> (a refuge),
because the King has recourse to the counsels of his Wezeer,
and his knowledge and prudence; others, again, from <em>azr</em> (back,
or strength), because the King is strengthened by his Wezeer, as
the human frame is strengthened by the back. The proper and
chief duties of a Wezeer are explained by the above, and by a
saying of the Prophet: ‘Whosoever is in authority over Muslims,
if God would prosper him, He giveth him a virtuous
Wezeer, who when he forgetteth his duty remindeth him, and
when he remembereth assisteth him; but if He would do otherwise,
He giveth him an evil Wezeer, who when he forgetteth
doth not remind him, and when he remembereth doth not assist
him.’”—The Kur’ān and the Sūnna (or Traditions) both distinctly
authorise a sovereign to select a Vizier to assist him in
the government. The Prophet makes Moses say (<cite>Kur.</cite> xx, 30):
“Give me a counsellor [Ar. <em>Wezeer</em>] of my family, namely Aaron
my brother;” and again, in ch. xxv, 37: “We appointed him
[Moses] Aaron his brother for a counsellor.” Wahidi, in his
commentary on the Kur’ān, says: “Wezeer signifies <em>refuge</em> and
<em>assistance</em>.” In the fourth year of his mission Muhammad
assumed the prophetic office, when “he prepared a banquet, a
lamb, as it is said, and a bowl of milk, for the entertainment of
forty guests of the race of Hashem. ‘Friends and kinsmen,’
said Muhammad to the assembly, ‘I offer you, and I alone
can offer, the most precious of gifts, the treasures of this world
and of the world to come. God has commanded me to call you
to His service. Who among you will <em>support my burthen</em>?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>Who among you will <em>be my companion and my vizier</em>?’”—<em>Gibbon</em>,
chap. 1.</p>

<p class='c009'>King Āzādbakht, we see, had no fewer than <em>ten</em> of such
“burden-bearers”; in chapter ix there is another King with
ten viziers; and in an ancient Indian romance referred to by El-Mas’ūdī
in his <cite>Meadows of Gold and Mines of Gems</cite>, the same
number of viziers is given to a king: “Shelkand and Shimas,
or the Story of an Indian King and his Ten Viziers”; in what
is probably a modernised version of the same romance, included
in the <cite>Thousand and One Nights</cite>, under the title of “King
Jilāa, the Vizier Shimas, and their Sons,” there are however but
Seven Viziers—the number in most of the romances of the <cite>Sindibād</cite>
cycle. According to the learned Imam El-Jara’ī, cited by
Lane, <em>ten</em> is the proper number of counsellors for any man: “It
is desirable,” says he, “for a man, before he enters upon any
important undertaking, to consult ten intelligent persons among
his particular friends; or if he have not more than five such
friends, let him consult each of them twice; or if he have not
more than one friend, he should consult him ten times, at ten
different visits<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c014'><sup>[35]</sup></a>;—if he have not one to consult, let him return
to his wife and consult her, and whatever she advises him to do,
<em>let him do the contrary</em>, so shall he proceed rightly in his affair
and attain his object.”—This reminds me of a story told of
Khōja Nasru-’d-Dīn Efendī, the Turkish joker, who, wishing to
make Timūr a present of some fruit, consulted his wife as to
whether he should take him figs or quinces, and on her answering,
“Oh, quinces, of course,” the Khōja, reflecting that a
woman’s advice is never good, took Timūr a basket of figs; and
when the emperor ordered his attendants to pelt the Khōja on
his bald pate with the ripe, juicy figs, he thanked Heaven that
he had not taken his wife’s advice: “for had I, as she advised,
brought quinces instead of figs, my head had surely been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>broken!”<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c014'><sup>[36]</sup></a> This most unjust estimate of women, so generally
held by Muslims and giving rise to such proverbial sayings as
“women have long hair and short wits,” is in accordance with
the atrocious saying ascribed (falsely, let us hope) to the Prophet:
“I stood at the gate of Paradise, and lo! most of its inmates
were poor; and I stood at the gate of Hell, and lo! most of its
inmates were <em>women</em>!” Contrast this with the following passage
from the <cite>Mahābharata</cite>: “The wife is half the man; a wife
is man’s dearest friend; a wife is the source of his religion, his
worldly profit, and his love. He who hath a wife maketh offerings
in his house. Those who have wives are blest with good
fortune. Wives are friends, who by their gentle speech soothe
ye in your retirement. In the performance of religious duties
they are as fathers; in your distresses they are as mothers<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c014'><sup>[37]</sup></a>; and
they are a refreshment to those who are travellers in the rugged
paths of life.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_16'>16</a>.</em> “Indulged in the pleasures of wine.”—The Kur’ān
prohibits the use of wine and all other intoxicating liquors:
“They will ask thee concerning wine and lots; answer, in both
there is great sin” (ch. ii, 216). Some of the early followers of
the Prophet held this text as doubtful, and continued to indulge
in wine; but another text enjoins them not to come to prayer
while they are drunk, until they know what they would say
(ch. iv, 46). From this it would appear that Muhammad “meant
merely to restrain his followers from unbecoming behaviour, and
other evil effects of intoxication;” serious quarrels, however,
resulting from drinking wine, a text in condemnation of the
practice was issued: “Ye who have become believers! verily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>wine, and lots, and images, and divining arrows are an abomination
of the work of the Devil; therefore avoid them that ye may
prosper” (ch. v, 92).—Mills was certainly in error in stating
that “for ages before the preaching of the Prophet of Mecca,
wine was but little drunk either in Egypt or Arabia.”<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c014'><sup>[38]</sup></a> In the
<cite>Mu`allaqāt</cite>, or Seven Poems suspended in the Temple at Mecca,
which present true pictures of Arabian manners and customs
during the century immediately preceding the time of Muhammad,
wine-drinking is frequently mentioned.  Thus the poet
`Amru calls for his morning draught of rich hoarded wine, saying
that it is the liquor which diverts the lover from his passion,
and even causes the miser to forget his pelf; Lebeid says that he
often goes to the shop of the wine-merchant, when he spreads
his flag in the air, and sells his wine at a high price; and the
poet-hero `Antar quaffs old wine when the noontide heat is
abated. However this may be, the law of the Kur’ān is clear—believers
are not allowed to drink intoxicating liquors. Yet it
would appear, from the tales of the <cite>Thousand and One Nights</cite>,
that wine was extensively drunk by the higher classes of Muslims
in all countries until a comparatively recent date; and assuredly
the wine there mentioned was not the harmless beverage which
the Prophet indulged in and permitted to his followers—“prepared
by putting grapes or dry dates in water to extract
their sweetness, and suffering the liquor to ferment slightly
until it acquired a little sharpness or pungency”—since we read
in the story, for instance, of “The Three Ladies of Bagdād and
the Porter,” that wine was drunk to intoxication. The modern
Persians justify their occasional excessive wine-drinking by the
remark: “there is as much sin in a flagon as in a glass;”<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c014'><sup>[39]</sup></a> and
the Turks despise the small glasses commonly used by Europeans
in their potations.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c014'><sup>[40]</sup></a> Cantemir, in his <cite>History of the Othman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>Empire</cite>, relates a curious story of how Murād IV, the seventeenth
Turkish Sultan (1622–1639), became a drunkard:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class='c009'>Not content to drink wine in private, Murād compelled even
the Muftis and other ministers to drink with him, and also, by a
public edict, allowed wine to be sold and drunk by men of all
ranks. It is said Murād was led into this degrading vice by a
man named Bakrī Mustafa. As the Sultan was one day going
about the market-place in disguise, he chanced to see this man
wallowing in the mud, almost dead drunk. Wondering at the
novelty of the thing, he inquired of his attendants what was the
matter with the man, who seemed to him a lunatic. Being told
that the fellow was drunk with wine, he wanted to know what
sort of liquor that was, of whose effects he was yet ignorant.
Meanwhile Mustafa gets up, and with opprobrious words bids the
Sultan stand off. Astonished at the man’s boldness, “Rascal!”
he exclaimed, “dost thou bid me, who am the Sultan Murād,
be gone?”—“And I,” answered the fellow, “am Bakrī [<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i>
the Drunkard] Mustafa, and if thou wilt sell me this city, I will
buy it, and then I shall be Sultan Murād, and thou Bakrī Mustafa.”—Murād
demanding where he would get the money to purchase
such a city, Mustafa replied: “Don’t trouble thyself about that;
for, what is more, I will buy, too, the son of a bond-woman.”<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c014'><sup>[41]</sup></a>
Murād agreed to this, and ordered Mustafa to be taken to the
palace. After some hours, the fumes of the wine being dispersed,
Mustafa came to his senses, and finding himself in a gilded and
sumptuous room, he inquired of those who attended him: “What
does this mean?—am I dreaming?—or do I taste of the pleasures
of Paradise?” They told him of what had passed, and of his
bargain with the Sultan. Upon this he fell into a great fright,
well knowing Murād’s fierce disposition. But necessity abetting
his invention, he declared himself on the point of death, unless
he could have some wine to restore his spirits. The keepers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>that he might not die before being brought into the Sultan’s
presence, gave him a pot full of wine, which he concealed in his
bosom. On being ushered into the audience-chamber, the
Sultan commanded him to pay so many millions as the price of
the city. Taking the pot of wine from his bosom, Mustafa said:
“This, O Sultan, is what would yesterday have purchased
Istambol. And were you likewise possessed of this wealth, you
would think it preferable to the sovereignty of the universe.”
Murād asked how that could be. “By drinking of this divine
liquor,” answered Mustafa, offering the cup to the Sultan, who,
from curiosity, took a large draught, which, as he was unused to
wine, immediately made him so drunk that he fancied the
world could not contain him. Afterwards growing giddy, he
was seized with sleep, and in a few hours waking with a headache,
sent for Mustafa, in a great passion. Mustafa instantly
appeared, and perceiving the case, “Here,” said he, “is your
remedy,” and gave him a cup of wine, by which his headache
was presently removed, and his former gladness restored.
When this had been repeated two or three times, Murād was by
degrees so addicted to wine that he was drunk almost every day.
Bakrī Mustafa, his tutor in drunkenness, was admitted among
the privy-counsellors, and was always near the Sultan. At his
death Murād ordered the whole court to go into mourning, but
caused his body to be buried with great pomp in a tavern among
the wine-casks. After his decease the Sultan declared he never
enjoyed one merry day; and when Mustafa chanced to be mentioned
he was often seen to burst into tears, and to sigh from
the bottom of his heart. “Seldom, if ever,” moralises Cantemir,
“has so much favour been obtained by the precepts of virtue as
Mustafa acquired by the dictates of vice.”</p>

<p class='c009'>To return to the quotation at the beginning of this long note;
that the wine in which our young hero Bakhtyār indulged to
such an extent as to deprive him of his senses was <em>not</em> a mild
beverage, admits of no question: again, in chapter viii, page 93,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>we find a King and his favourite companion carousing together,

says: “No one whose origin is bad ever catches the reflection
of the good” (ch. i, tale 4); and again: “How can we make
a good sword out of bad iron? A worthless person cannot by
education become a person of worth;” and yet again: “Evil
habits, which have taken root in one’s nature, will only be got
rid of at the hour of death.” Firdausī, the Homer of Persia, in his
scathing satire on the Sultan Mahmūd of Ghazni, has the following
remarks on the same subject:</p>

be expiated by deep repentance.—<em>Lane.</em></p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c009'>In Cazotte’s French rendering—or rather, adaptation—of the
Arabian version of this work, under the title of “The Story of
King Bohetzad and his Ten Viziers,” the name of the young
hero is not Bakhtyār, but Aladdin—properly, `Ala`u-’d-Dīn,
“Exaltation of the Faith”; for Sipahsālār there is a prime
minister whose name is Asphand, and his daughter, Baherjoa,
was being conveyed, not to the Vizier, as in our version, but to
the Prince of Babylon, to whom she was to be married. The
order of the tales varies from that in the Persian work and two
additional tales are interpolated. There is one point, however,
in which this rendering, or version, is, I think, superior to the
Persian, namely, that while in the Bakhtyār-story we are told
that after the King recovered his throne and kingdom, he and
the Queen “passed their days in tranquillity, interrupted only
by the remembrance of their child, whom they had left in the
desert, and whom, they were persuaded, wild beasts must have
devoured the same hour in which they abandoned him,” but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>they do not appear to have taken any steps to ascertain his fate;—in
Cazotte’s version trusty messengers are despatched far and
wide to learn, if possible, tidings of the child, though without
success. This is but natural, and what we should expect, particularly
on the part of an Eastern monarch, from the well-known
affection of Asiatics for their male offspring, which are considered
as the light or splendour of the house; and if it be an interpolation
by Cazotte—one of the “disfigurements” of which he is accused
by Deslongchamps<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c014'><sup>[43]</sup></a>—it is very decidedly an improvement on
his original.—Bohetzād’s kingdom is called Dineroux, “which
comprehends all Syria, and the Isles of India lying at the mouth
of the Persian Gulf;” his capital is Issessara. One or two other
points of difference may also find a place here. In our translation,
when the royal fugitives abandoned their infant in the
desert, “their hearts were afflicted with anguish;” but in
Lescallier’s French rendering, the King is represented as exclaiming,
on this occasion: “O my dear infant! thy father
sheds rivers of tears from his eyes, because of thy absence, like
the father of Joseph the Egyptian, when his son was departed
from the land of Canaan!”—while according to Cazotte: “Great
God!” cried the afflicted mother, bedewing her babe with her
tears, “who didst watch over the safety of young Ishmael,
preserve this innocent babe!” The reference to Ishmael is
possibly an alteration by the Arabian translator.—It is not,
as in the Persian work, the King of Kirmān of whom the
fugitive pair seek protection and assistance, but Kassera,
King of Persia—no doubt, meaning Khusrū (called by the
Greeks Chosroes), the general title of the Persian Kings of the
Sassanian dynasty, thus, Khusrū Parvīz, Khusrū Nushirvān.
He furnishes Bohetzād with an immense army for the recovery
of his kingdom, and the Queen (Baherjoa) remains under his
protection until Bohetzād should have punished his rebellious
Vizier. But meanwhile the King of Persia becomes deeply enamoured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>of the beauteous Baherjoa; and when envoys arrive
from Bohetzād to bring back the Queen, Khusrū’s first impulse
is to refuse to deliver her up, but at length better feelings prevail
over his passion, and he restores her to the envoys in a
magnificent litter, and with numerous female attendants.</p>

from the white stones (<em>basra</em>) near and around it. Renowned

Irrigated by the river Ayla, which falls into the Tigris close to

and learned men, and became desirous of visiting his court.
Hearing of this wish, and desirous himself of forming an acquaintance
with Hāfiz, Sultān Mahmūd sent him, through the
hands of his vizier, Mīr Fazlu’llāh Anjū, an invitation and a
handsome sum of money to defray the expenses of his journey.
Thereupon he set out and advanced on his expedition as far as
Lār. There he encountered a friend who had been plundered by
robbers, on whom he bestowed a part of his money, and not
having left himself sufficient to prosecute his journey, was compelled
to accept the assistance of two merchants whom he
fortunately met with there, and who kindly took him with them
to Hurmuz. There he found a ship ready to sail to the Dek’han,
and took his passage in her. But a storm having arisen, he was
so terrified by it, that he abandoned his intention, and sending
a letter of excuse to the vizier, with an ode to the King, returned
himself to Shīrāz. He says:</p>

Persian climate and the deficiency of rivers have exercised in
ancient (<cite>Polybius</cite>, lib. 10, 25) as in modern times the ingenuity
of the natives in the discovery of springs.—In the Story of Abū
Temām (page <a href='#Page_98'>98</a>) a city is also described as “adorned with
gardens and running streams.” It was a saying of Muhammad
that “three things fortify the sight: looking at verdure, at running
water, and at a handsome face.”</p>

<em>stranger</em>&nbsp;... and the traveller” (<em>ibnu-’s sabīl</em>: son of the road).
The practice of hospitality among the pre-Islamite Arabs is too
well known to require more than passing mention, and reference
to Professor Lee’s note on Job xxi, 16.</p>

round the turban.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_25'>25</a>.</em> “Account of his property” &amp;c.—signet, chattels,
and ledger—“and said, ‘you must manifest your zeal in the
seasons of sowing and of harvest, and become the <em>mushrif</em> of my
property.’” A <em>mushrif</em> is an officer of the treasury, who authenticates
accounts and writings. The <em>dihkān</em> gave him his signet,
in order that he might transact his business with full authority.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>“Seals, or signets,” says Dr H. H. Wilson, “were from the
earliest periods commonly used in the East. Ahasuerus takes
his signet off his hand and gives it, first to Haman, and again to
Mordecai; and Herodotus notices that each of the Babylonians
wore a seal-ring. The Greeks and Romans had their rings
curiously engraved with devices, and that cast by Polycrates into
the sea was the work of an engraver whose name the historian
has thought not unworthy of commemoration. The use of the
seal amongst the Orientals at the present day is not, as with us,
to secure an envelope, but to verify letters and documents in
place of a written signature. Amongst the natives of Hindūstān,
both Muhammadan and Hindū, the seal is engraved with the
name of the wearer, and the surface being smeared superficially
only with ink, the application of the seal to the paper leaves the
letters which are cut in the stone white on a black ground. Such
also was the manner in which the seals of the Greeks and Romans
were applied.” Lane, in his <cite>Modern Egyptians</cite>, says: “On the
little finger of the right hand is worn a seal-ring (<em>Khātim</em>), which
is generally of silver, with a cornelian, or other stone, upon which
is engraved the wearer’s name; the name is accompanied by the
words ‘his servant’—signifying the servant, or worshipper, of
God—and often by other words expressive of the person’s trust
in God, &amp;c. (see St. John’s Gospel iii, 33, and Exodus xxxix,
30). The Prophet disapproved of gold; therefore few Muslims
wear gold rings; but the women have various ornaments (rings,
bracelets &amp;c.) of that precious metal. The impression of the
seal-ring is considered as more valid than the sign-manual.
Therefore giving the ring to another person is the utmost mark
of confidence.—See Genesis xli, 42.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_27'>27</a>.</em> “Bit the finger of amazement.”—Biting the hand
or finger is a common mode in the East of manifesting surprise,
grief, or anger. Thus in the Kur’ān, xxv, 29: “On that day
the unjust person shall bite his hands for anguish;” and iii, 119:
“When they assemble together privately they bite their fingers’-ends
out of wrath against you.” In the <cite>Gulistān</cite> of Sa`dī, i, 4:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>“The King seized the hand of amazement with his teeth;”
again, v, 19: “Thine enemy bites the back of his hand through
vexation;” and again, vii, 19: “The fingers of astonishment
were between their teeth.” In one of the beautiful poems of
Bahāu-’d-Dīn Zuhayr, of Egypt (<span class='fss'><abbr title='Anno Dominem'>A.D.</abbr></span> 1186–1258), elegantly

“and they deprived him of whatever they had given.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_27'>27</a>.</em> “For the sake of God:” a common phrase among
Muslims. A rather humorous example of its use occurs in the
<cite>Gulistān</cite> (chap, iv, tale 14): A harsh-voiced man was reading
the Kur’ān in a loud tone. A pious man passed by him, and
said: “What is thy monthly stipend?”—“Nothing,” he replied.—“Why
then,” he inquired, “dost thou give thyself all this
trouble?”—“I read <em>for the sake of God</em>,” he replied.—“For
God sake, then, <em>don’t read</em>,” said he.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_27'>27</a>.</em>  “A pearl of such exquisite beauty,” &amp;c.—In the
East it is popularly believed that the pearl is formed in the oyster
from a rain-drop: Sa’dī, in the fourth book of his <cite>Bustān</cite>, has
some beautiful verses on this notion, in which he inculcates the
practice of humility. Pearls are called <em>marvārīd</em>, “production of
light,” and, usually when they are unpierced, <em>lū’lū’</em>, “luminous,”
“brilliant.” They are divided into twelve classes, each having
a distinctive name, according to their “water” or lustre; the
first class being called <em>shahvār</em>, “the regal,” the clearest, purest,
and most lustrous. Pearls are also divided into twelve classes,
according to shape. They are further divided, in respect of size,
into fifteen classes, according to the number of holes in the different
sieves through which they are passed, from the smallest, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>which twelve hundred weigh a <em>miskal</em>, up to the largest, of which
forty weigh a <em>miskal</em>. The best pearl-fisheries are at Ceylon,
and in the Persian Gulf, at Bahrayn, Kīsh, and Sharak; but the
Arabian pearls are less prized than the Indian. Their colour and
quality are said to depend on the bottom of the sea where they
are produced: in black slime they are dark; in shallow waters,
yellowish.—Tavernier mentions a remarkable pearl found at
Katifa, in Arabia, the fishery probably alluded to by Pliny (<cite>Nat.
Hist.</cite> b. ix, c. 54), which he purchased for £10,000 of our
money! It is said to be now in the possession of the Shah
of Persia.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_28'>28</a>.</em> “He put three of the pearls into his mouth and
the other three among his clothes.”—It is customary for travellers
and others in the East to conceal their money and valuables about
their clothes and in the folds of their turbans. Many Oriental
stories illustrate this practice. For example, in the tale of the
Poor Ropemaker (<cite>Arabian Nights</cite>—vol. vi, of Jonathan Scott’s
edition), he receives a sum of money from a benevolent stranger,
and having laid out a moiety of it in material for his trade, he
places the remainder within the folds of his turban-cloth, but
unluckily a bird snatches it off his head and flies away with it.
And in the Talmud there is a story of a poor Hebrew, named
Joseph, who paid great respect to the Sabbath. This man
had a wealthy neighbour, who was a firm believer in judicial
astrology, and having been told by a sagacious professor of the
science that all his riches should one day become the property of
the Sabbath-observing Joseph, he straightway sold his estate and
invested the proceeds in a large diamond, which he secretly sewed
within his turban, and departed in a vessel for some distant country—thus
preventing, as he fondly imagined, the verification of the
astrologer’s prediction. But his precautions were of no avail, for
while standing on the deck of the vessel, a sudden gust of wind
carried his turban, with all his wealth, into the sea. What became
of the ruined man after this misfortune we are not informed.
But we are told that, some time after this accident, the pious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>Joseph went to the market and bought a fish to furnish his table
on the Sabbath eve. On opening the fish, the diamond which
his old neighbour had lost with his turban was found in its
stomach—and thus was the good man’s strict observance of the
Sabbath rewarded, and the astrologer’s prediction fulfilled to the
letter.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_28'>28</a>.</em> The unlucky Merchant’s adventure with the covetous
and dishonest jeweller finds a curious parallel in an incident
in the “Story of the Jackal, the Barber, and the Brāhman,” one
of the charming fairy tales in Miss Frere’s <cite>Old Deccan Days</cite>.
The poor Brāhman, however, though robbed of the precious
stones he offers to the jeweller for sale, escapes home all safe,
unlike the Merchant of our story. Possibly the incident in both
tales had a common origin;—yet the “roguery of villanous man”
(to employ <em>honest</em> Jack Falstaff’s phrase) is pretty much alike in
all ages and countries!</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_29'>29</a>.</em> “They distributed some money among those who
were confined.”—Alms are recommended in many passages of
the Kur’ān: “Pay your legal alms,” ii, 43; “alms are to be
distributed to the poor and the needy&nbsp;... for the redemption
of captives, insolvent debtors, and, for religion’s sake, unto the
traveller,” ix, 53, 60. Alms are of two kinds: (1) obligatory
(or <em>zakāt</em>), ii, 172; and (2) voluntary (or <em>sadakāt</em>), as in the
present instance. In scripture we find a trace of the same doctrine:
see Daniel iv, 27. The Khalif `Omar Ibn `Abdu-’l-`Azīz
used to say: “<em>Prayer</em> carries us half-way to God; <em>Fasting</em> brings
us to the door of the palace; and <em>Alms</em> procure us admission.”
And assuredly no Eastern moralist has more frequently or more
impressively and beautifully inculcated the duty of alms-giving
and of liberality than Sa`dī. He tells us in the <cite>Gulistān</cite>, ii, 49,
that on the monument of Bahrām Gūr, a famous Persian King,
was written: “The liberal hand is better than the strong arm;”
and adds: “Distribute in alms the tithe of thy wealth; for the
more the husbandman loppeth off the exuberance of the vine,
the more it will yield of grapes.” And in his <cite>Bustān</cite>, or Fruit-Garden,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>b. ii, he says: “Bestow thy gold and thy wealth while
they are thine; for when thou art gone they will be no longer in
thy power.... Distribute thy treasure readily to-day, for
to-morrow the key may no longer be in thy hand....
Exert thyself to cast a covering over the poor, that God’s own
veil may be a covering for thee.”<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c014'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_30'>30</a>.</em> “When he had related the story of the Merchant
and of the pearls which they had given him”—the text adds,
“and the other five divers had confirmed what he said.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_30'>30</a>.</em> “He was then led away to execution; and the
King caused to be proclaimed throughout the city,” &amp;c. So, too,
in the <cite>Thousand and One Nights</cite>, the Barber relates how his
Fourth Brother was punished with a hundred lashes, “after
which they mounted him upon a camel, and proclaimed before
him: ‘This is the recompense of him who breaketh into men’s
houses.’” Morier, in his <cite>Second Journey</cite>, gives a graphic
description of the punishment of Muhammad Zamān Khān,
governor of Astrābād, who, in 1814, “entered into a league with
the Turkmāns, disavowed the King’s authority, and even made
pretensions to the royal power and prerogative.” The King
offered a reward for his capture; and the people of Astrābād
surrounded the traitor’s palace, forced their way into the room
where he was seated, seized and bound him, and carried him
before the King. “When he had reached the camp, the King
ordered the chief of his camel-artillery to put a mock-crown
upon the rebel’s head, armlets on his arms, a sword by his side;
to mount him upon an ass, with his face towards the tail and
the tail in his hand; then to parade him throughout the camp,
and to proclaim: ‘This is he who wished to be King!’ After
this was over, and the people had mocked and insulted him, he
was brought before the King, who called for the looties and
ordered them to turn him into ridicule by making him dance and
perform antics against his will. He then ordered that whoever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>chose might spit in his face. After this he received the
bastinado on the soles of his feet, which was administered by
the chiefs of his own tribe; and some time after he had his eyes
put out.—The strong coincidence,” adds Morier, “between
these details and the most awfully affecting part of our own
scripture history is a striking illustration of the permanence of
Eastern manners.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_30'>30</a>.</em> “Appointed him keeper of the treasury.”—The
sudden elevation of persons from a humble and even distressed
condition to places of great dignity and wealth has ever been a
characteristic of the absolute monarchs of Eastern countries, as
well as the degradation and ruin, frequently from mere caprice,
and seldom with any justification, of men of the highest rank.
The most remarkable instance of the many which Oriental
history presents is the execrable conduct of the Khalif
Hārūnu-’r-Rāshīd, so undeservedly celebrated in the <cite>Thousand
and One Nights</cite>, in murdering his principal Vizier Ja`far
and utterly ruining the other members of the noble house of
Barmak (the Barmecides of our common translation of the
<cite>Arabian Nights</cite>), all of whom were as famed for their unbounded
liberality as for their brilliant abilities. An interesting account
of the Barmakis and their ruin is given in Dr Jonathan Scott’s
<cite>Tales, Anecdotes, &amp;c., from the Arabic and Persian</cite>.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_32'>32</a>.</em> “Put out the Merchant’s eyes.”—A too common
and barbarous punishment in the East. In Turkey a needle
was used for this purpose in the case of state prisoners. The
Arabian poet-hero `Antar is said to have blinded his implacable
and treacherous enemy Wezār by passing a red-hot
sword-blade close before his eyes. Years afterwards the blinded
chief executed poetical justice by slaying `Antar with a poisoned
arrow, which he shot at him on the bank of the Euphrates.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c009'>In Cazotte’s version this story is entitled “The Obstinate
Man,” perhaps more appropriately than our “Ill-fated Merchant,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>since his own wrong-headedness was the main cause of
his misfortunes. His place of abode is Bagdād, not Basra.
The divers give him <em>ten</em> pearls. The jeweller, having been
lately robbed of some pearls, believes Kaskas (such is the
man’s name) to be the thief, and accordingly he accuses him;
and when the latter is proved to be innocent, the jeweller is
punished with two hundred blows of the bastinado.  The
catastrophe is very differently related: One day he observed in
the apartment which had been assigned to him, a door walled-up
and concealed by a slight covering of mastic, which was now so
much wasted by the effects of time that it crumbled into dust on
the slightest touch. Without any exertion of strength, he opened
this door and entered unthinkingly into a rich apartment entirely
unknown to him, but which he found to be in the interior of the
palace. Hardly had he advanced two or three steps when he
was perceived by the chief of the eunuchs, who instantly reported
what he had seen to the King. The monarch came immediately
to the spot. The fragments of the mastic remained upon the
ground to show that the door had been forced open, and the
stupid amazement of Kaskas completed the appearance of his
guilt. “Wretch!” said the King, “dost thou thus repay my
favours? My justice saved thee, when I believed thee innocent;
now thou art guilty, and I condemn thee to lose thy sight.”
The imprudent Kaskas durst not even attempt to justify himself,
but was immediately delivered into the hands of the executioner,
of whom the only favour he asked was, that he would give him
his eyes when he had torn them from their sockets.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c014'><sup>[46]</sup></a> He went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>groping through the streets of the capital with them in his hands,
crying: “Behold, all ye good people who hear me, what the
unfortunate Kaskas has gained by striving against the decrees of
Destiny, and despising the advice of his friends!”</p>

<p class='c009'>And Sa`di, in his <cite>Bustān</cite>, b. <span class='fss'>I</span>, regarding the duties of a king,
says: “If thou sheddest blood, it must not be done without a
decree.” But there is too much reason to believe that Eastern
monarchs have seldom been guided by the law in administering
punishment. Many of the Muslim princes of Northern Africa,
in particular, have slain even favourite attendants, from sheer
wantonness and love of bloodshed.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span><em>Page <a href='#Page_34'>34</a>.</em> Aleppo.—The Berica of the Greeks; Aleppo is
the Italian form of <em>Hālab</em>, the native name. On the fall of
Palmyra, Hālabu-’s-Shabha (Hālab the ash-coloured) became
the grand emporium for the productions of Persia and India,
conveyed by caravans from Bagdād and Basra to be shipped at
Iskenderūn, or Latakia, for the different ports of Europe.
Under the Greek sovereigns of Syria, Aleppo acquired great
wealth and consequence, and flourished still more under the
Roman Emperors. An aqueduct, constructed before the time of
Constantine, conveys a plentiful supply of water from the
springs; and the mosques Jāmī, Zacharī, and Halawé, originally
Christian churches, are fine specimens of the ancient Roman
style, the latter built by the Empress Helena. To the peculiar
quality of the water of the Kuwayk (ancient Chalus), which
irrigates its far-famed gardens, is ascribed the ring-worm (<em>hābala-’s-sina</em>),
which attacks the natives once in their lives, and leaves
an indelible scar, which distinguishes an Aleppine throughout
the East. In 1797 Aleppo was the victim of the plague, and of
earthquakes in 1822 and 1830.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_34'>34</a>.</em> “Protected strangers.”—The text reads: “A friend

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_35'>35</a>.</em> “When the young man had advanced thus far in
his narrative;” the lithographed text says, “when the boon
companion had described the lady.”—Readers familiar with
Oriental fictions will probably recollect many instances of princes
and others becoming enamoured, not only at sight of the
portrait of a beautiful woman, but at the mere description of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>charms: in such celebrated collections of tales as the <cite>Arabian
Nights</cite>, the Persian Tales ascribed to the Dervish Mokles of
Isfahān, and the <cite>Bahār-i-Danish</cite> (Spring of Knowledge) of
`Ināyatu-’llah of Dihli. In the Bedawī <cite>Romance of `Antar</cite>, a noble
`Absian named Amara, “a conceited coxcomb, very particular
in his dress, fond of perfumes, and always keeping company
with women and young girls,” having heard of the beauty of
Abla, sends a female slave to the tents of her family to discover
whether the damsel was as beautiful as was reported of her;
and the girl returning with a glowing account of Abla’s charms,
the Bedawī exquisite immediately conceives a violent passion
for her—“his ears fell in love before his eyes.”—There is at
least one instance on record of a European becoming enamoured
from imagination; in the case of Geoffrey Rudel, the gallant
troubadour, who fell desperately in love with the Countess of
Tripoli, from a description of her beauty and accomplishments:
but see the story in Warton’s <cite>History of English Poetry</cite>.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_35'>35</a>.</em> “The city of Rūm, the capital and residence of
the Kaisar, or Greek Emperor”: Constantinople.—The signification
of “Rūm” is very vague, as it may denote Rome, the
Turkish Empire, Greece, or Rumelia (Rūm Eyli). The Persians
called the chief of the Seljukī dynasty at Konia (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i> Iconium),
Kaisar-i-Rūm. D’Herbelot defines the term Rūm as applicable
to the countries which the Romans, and afterwards the Greeks
and Turks, subdued under their domination. “Roumy [Rūmī],”
observes Burckhardt, “is a word applied by the Arabs to the
Greeks of the Lower Empire, and afterwards to all Christians.”
(<cite>Travels in Nubia</cite>, App. n. iii.) The Persian proverb, <cite>Ez
Rūm ta Shām</cite>, “from Rūm to Syria,” is quoted to indicate an
extent of territory. Kaisar (Cæsar, whence Czar) was the general
title of the sovereigns of the Lower Empire, as Khusrū was that
of the Persian Kings of the Sassanian dynasty.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_36'>36</a>.</em> “Prince Bihzād immediately arose, and hastened
to the house of the Vizier, and said,” &amp;c.—The following is a
close translation of this passage as given in the lithographed text:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>“You must go this moment and tell my father, Bihzād
says thus: ‘Thou dost not turn thine eye upon me and hast
not any care for me. There is no mortal in the world to
whom a wife should not be given; if thou carest for me, you
would bestow on me a help-mate.’” The Vizier replied: “Your
order I obey;” then rose up and went to the King’s palace,
asked for an audience, and reported to the King all that Bihzād
had said. The King said: “Bihzād has fallen in love; say to
him, ‘This wish is in my thoughts; but I have paused until I
could discover some companion for thy sake; but if there be a
longing for any one, speak out that I may give it my attention—that
I may effect a settlement, and bring this thy desire within
thy embrace.’”—The Vizier returned, and repeated to Bihzād
what the King had said, to which Bihzād replied: “Go and
tell my father that the Kaisar of Rūm has a daughter, Nigārīn<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c014'><sup>[47]</sup></a>
by name; he must send ambassadors and demand the daughter
on my behalf.” The Vizier returned and told the King, who
became unhappy.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_37'>37</a>.</em> “The Vizier returned to Bihzād, and delivered him
this message from his father.”—The lithographed text says:</p>

<p class='c009'>When Bihzād perceived that the King showed no eagerness in
asking for the lady, he said to the Vizier: “If the King will not
demand the daughter for me, I will leave the country.” The
Vizier said: “I will go and speak to the King to that effect.” He
went, and repeated according to Bihzād’s words. The King
loved his son to excess, and seeing no resource, sent ambassadors
to the Kaisar of Rūm.  When the ambassadors arrived
at the capital of Rūm, and the news reached the King, he
commanded an <em>istikbāl</em>, and that they should enter the city
with all due honours and respect. The next day the Kaisar
invited the ambassadors to a <em>durbar</em>. When they came before
the King and had bowed their faces to the ground, they delivered
the message of the Shāh of Aleppo. The King said: “Maybe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>the wealth [dominion, power?] of the Kaisar does not enter into
your [mind’s] eye;—you must be brief and laconic, and utter
this reply: ‘One hundred lacs of dīnars is the covenant of my
daughter’s hand; whoever will give one hundred lacs of dīnars,

dismissed the ambassadors.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_37'>37</a>.</em> “One hundred lacs of dīnars.”—The value of the
<em>dīnar</em> (originally <em>din-ār</em>, “brought into circulation by the law”)
varied considerably at different periods, but the average value is
about ten shillings.  As a <em>lac</em> is one hundred thousand, and the
Kaisar demanded a hundred lacs; taking the value of the dīnar
at ten shillings, this would amount to five million pounds of
our money: but Oriental romancers are fond of dealing with
immense sums of money—on paper! “The Persians,” says
Chardin, “express silver money by the term <em>dirhem</em>, or <i><span lang="fro" xml:lang="fro">dragme</span></i>,
and that of gold by that of <em>dīnar</em>, or <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">denier</span></i>. They reckon by
<em>dīnar-bisty</em> and <em>tomāns</em>, although they have not any pieces of
money so called. There is the common dīnar, and the legal
dīnar (or chemy) and the dīnar-chemy signify the weight and
the value of a dīnar of gold, or of a gold crown.  A bisty makes
ten dīnars, or deniers, and a tomān ten thousand dīnars.”
(<cite>Voyage en Perse, &amp;c.</cite>, ii, 91–2.)</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_38'>38</a>.</em> “They produced twenty lacs.”—Bihzād said:
“Make a forced contribution throughout the land, and [demand]
one-eighth of the garden [produce].” The Pādishāh replied:
“This I will never do, for the city is small and the people have
not the means; every one would take flight and be ruined.”
Bihzād said: “A portion of the sum [required] exact by a forced
contribution; after that, about the remainder let us not concern
ourselves” [<em>lit.</em> eat anxiety]. The Pādishāh was incapable [of
further opposition]; he commanded that the land [owners] should
make a present of twenty lacs of dīnars.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_40'>40</a>.</em> “Set out upon his journey.”—For what purpose?
Surely not to go and demand the Kaisar’s daughter in marriage,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>without payment of the balance of the stipulated hundred lacs?
Sir William Ouseley has omitted to add that <em>loot</em> was the object
of Bihzād’s expedition. The text says that, with two confidential
attendants Bihzād set out upon his journey, “<em>until he should fall
in with a caravan, and make up the total sum required</em>.” The

<p class='c009'>was very commonly put into practice in former times by Arabian
lovers in order to procure the dowry. Thus, in the <cite>Romance of
`Antar</cite>, which Von Hammer says presents true pictures of
Arabian life about the age of Nushirvān the Just, King of Persia
(sixth century), Malik, the father of the beauteous Abla, requires
`Antar to procure for her dowry a thousand Asafīr camels by
plundering the owner, Mundzir, King of Hīra; and when
Khalid demands his cousin Jaida in marriage of her father, the
heroic damsel consents, on condition that he provide for
slaughter at her wedding-feast a thousand camels belonging to
the “Brandisher of Spears,” which he does by plundering the
tribe of `Āmir; and when Malik the perfidious father of
Abla betrothes her to the Bedawī exquisite Amara (mentioned
in a previous note), he collects a party of his followers and sets
out on a looting expedition to procure her dowry.—Prince
Bihzād, however, appears to have “caught a Tartar” in attacking
the caravan which he and his comrades overtook—“in the
morning,” according to our translation—“at the hour of mid-day
prayer,” says the lithographed text. The old Arabs always
made their attacks on the tents of a hostile tribe, and on caravans,
in the early morning—on the first gray streaks of dawn appearing,
and this is frequently alluded to in their poetry. Thus in the
<cite>Mu`allaqa</cite> of Hareth: “They assembled their forces at night,
and as soon as the dawn appeared, there was nothing heard
among them but a tumultuous noise, of those who called and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>those who answered; the neighing of horses, and, among the rest,
the lowing of camels.” In the <cite>Romance of `Antar</cite>, the heroic
Prince Malik is represented as being slain in one of those
morning raids, when his bridal party were attacked by Hadifa
and his tribesmen: “by morning their joys were converted into
sorrows, and shots were precipitated at them from arrows
for which there is no surgeon.” To wish peace in the
morning was therefore among the Arabs a most appropriate
salutation. So `Antar, in his famous <cite>Mu`allaqa</cite> (verse 2),
exclaims: “O bower of Abla, in the valley of Jiwā, give me
tidings of my love! O bower of Abla, may the morning rise on
thee with prosperity and health!” And Zuhayr, also author of
a <cite>Mu`allaqa</cite>, on viewing the traces of his mistress’ former abode:
“Hail, sweet bower! may thy morning be fair and auspicious!”</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c009'>This story is the fourth in Cazotte’s version, in which it presents
so few points of resemblance to the tale as given in the
Persian work that we must conclude it has been thus altered by
the Arabian translator.  Bihzād is the son of King Cyrus,
founder of the Syrian empire; and the beautiful lady with whom
he falls in love from the description of her charms is the daughter
of one of his father’s vassals.  He avows his passion to the
King his father, who immediately sends messengers to his vassal,
demanding his daughter in marriage to his son. The dowry of
three hundred thousand pieces of gold is agreed upon, but the
lady’s father stipulates that the marriage should be delayed for
the space of nine months. This seemed an eternity to the
impatient Prince, so he mounts his best horse, and sets out to
claim his bride at once. On the way he falls into the hands of
a gang of robbers and is compelled to join them. They attack
a caravan and are defeated, the Prince, among others, being
taken prisoner. The merchants present Bihzād to their King,
who recognises him from the description of his person in a
circular letter which he had received from King Cyrus. This King
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>despatches some troops along with Bihzād to the young lady’s
father. On his arrival preparations are made for the celebration
of the marriage: only three days have now to pass; but Bihzād,
impatient to behold his bride, looks through a small grated
window in her pavilion; and a eunuch, placed there on guard,
not knowing the Prince, struck him with the point of his scimitar,
which ran through both his eyes.</p>

<h3 class='c023'><span class='sc'>Notes on Chapter IV.</span></h3>

<p class='c021'><em>Page <a href='#Page_45'>45</a>.</em> According to the lithographed text: “The Fourth
Vizier presented himself before the King and said: ‘Of all the
admirable qualities [becoming] a King forbearance is the most
praiseworthy, and occasions general tranquillity; but inasmuch
as the forbearance [towards] Bakhtyār exceeds all bounds, it brings
evil repute to the King and kingdom, just as the [moderate]
tasting of meat is legitimate, but to eat to excess produces violent
fever.’”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_45'>45</a>.</em> “Let him not be precipitate in putting me to
death.”—The text goes on to say: “For precipitation in the end
leads only to repentance. Through impatience a man falls from
sovereignty, but whoever practises patience obtains it, and is
free from calamity. If the King would permit, just as his
servant has described [the career of] the Impatient Bihzād, he
would also, at the service of the King, make known Abū Saber’s
patience, and thus shed light on the illumined mind of the King,
[showing] how by patience extensive dominion accrues to a
human being.” The King said: “Abū Saber, who was he?
And practising what degree of patience, and in what manner,
did he acquire dominion and sovereignty? Relate.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_46'>46</a>.</em> Abū Saber (<em>Sabr</em>), literally, “Father of Patience.”—This
story offers a striking example of the practice of patience, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>virtue enjoined by the Kur’ān (ii, 148): “O true believers, beg
assistance with patience (<em>bi-’s-sabri</em>) and prayer, for God is with
the patient (<em>inna-’llāha ma`a-’s-sabirīn</em>).”—Travellers in the East
are daily reminded of this text: you engage camels; at the time
appointed, they are not ready; you seek, and find the owner
smoking in a coffee-shop; to your remonstrances he replies:
“Have patience, Efendī—<em>inna-’llāha ma`a-’s-sabirīn</em>.” An
Egyptian friend visits you while you are still agitated, and his
only words are: <em>Sabr kun—inna-’llāha ma`a-’s-sabirīn</em>: Have
patience—God is with the patient. In a flutter of indignation
you bring your complaint before my Lord Judge (<em>Māvlāna
Kazī</em>), who summons and expostulates with the offender,
and then, with a smile, assures you, <em>inna-’llāha ma`a-’s-sabirīn</em>!—Persian
authors are profuse in their praise of patience.
Sa`dī (<cite>Gulistān</cite>, i, 27) illustrates the double meaning of <em>Sabr</em>,
which signifies the “aloe” as well as “patience:”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>

<p class='c009'>And in the same excellent work (iii, 1) he says: “The
treasure chosen by Lukmān was patience; without patience there
is no such thing as wisdom.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_46'>46</a>.</em> “A tax-gatherer”—<em>`Amil</em>—is inferior to an <em>Amīn</em>,
who regulates the revenues of a district, and to a <em>Zamin-dār</em>, a
landed proprietor.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_46'>46</a>.</em> “Extorted (<em>Kharāj</em>) tribute from the poor
peasants.”—<em>Kharāj-guzār</em>, “a tribute-paying subject,” differs
from <em>dhimī</em> (<em>zimmiy</em>), who pays an annual tribute, and is
entitled to the protection of the Muslims and to most of the civil
rights which they enjoy; but he has also—in Egypt, at least—to
pay the income-tax in common with Muslims. (See Lane’s
<cite>Modern Egyptians</cite>.)</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_46'>46</a>.</em> “With cruelty and injustice,” &amp;c.—“Most of the
governors of provinces and districts,” says Lane (<cite>Modern
Egypt.</cite>), “carry their oppression far beyond the limits to which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>they are authorised to proceed by the Pasha; and even the
Shaikh of a village, in executing the commands of his superiors,
abuses his lawful power: bribes and the ties of relationship and
marriage influence him and them; and by lessening the
oppression of some, who are more able to bear it, greatly
increase that of others.” The peasants of Egypt only pay taxes
after a severe bastinading: “the more easily the peasant pays,
the more he is made to pay;” they are “proud of the stripes
they receive for withholding their contributions; and are often
heard to boast of the number of blows which were inflicted upon
them before they would give up their money.... It may
be hardly necessary to add, that few of them engage with
assiduity in the labours of agriculture, unless compelled to do so
by their superiors.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_47'>47</a>.</em>  “He replied, that patience was his only remedy.”—The
lithographed text thus proceeds:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class='c009'>The peasants retired void of hope, and remained [quiet] in
the village until the day when the King of the territory came in
that direction for the chase. The peasants hastened out of the
village, and raised a cry [of lamentation], saying: “We are
peasants, the tributaries and well-wishers of his Majesty. At
the time when the collector, entering this village, executed his
duties cruelly towards us, and had no mercy upon us poor people,
a party of evil-doers slew the tax-gatherer and fled. This news
reaching the ears of the King, he commanded the village
to be laid waste, and we, the guiltless, were set aside. After
this we were in misery and affliction, and could do but little
seed-sowing and harvest. Three years afterwards a lion formed
his lair in the neighbouring district of the village, and he killed
many children and camels; and from dread of the lion we were
unable to go out of doors, and were reduced to [a state of] starvation
and nakedness.” Thus did they speak, and, with
lamentations and groans, shed tears. Pity for them came over
[the mind of] the King, who asked: “Why, at the time of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>the murder of the collector, did you not come before me, and
represent your own state of affairs, and beg me to forbear from
the command to lay your village waste?” The peasants replied:
“In the village there is a man who is our chief; whatever affair
we undertake, we confer with him, [that] he may devise the
proper course [to pursue]. We told him of this state of affairs,
and he was not one with us, and he did not think it advisable
we should come into the presence of the King.” At these
words the King became angry, and commanded they should
expel this man from the village.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_48'>48</a>.</em>—“Abū Saber recommended patience.”—According
to the lithographed text: Have patience (<em>sabr kun</em>); since by
patience that which was obscure becomes manifest, [even as] a
lamp lights up [darkness].</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_48'>48</a>.</em>  “She contrived to write upon the ground with
blood.”—Of what service blood could be in tracing letters in
the sand is not very obvious: the lithographed text simply says,
that “when she perceived there was no remedy, she wrote on
the ground: ‘A robber has carried me off!’”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_49'>49</a>.</em> “Every stranger&nbsp;... was by his command
seized and compelled to work,” &amp;c.—No doubt many of the
magnificent palaces and other edifices in Eastern countries, like
the famous Pyramids near Cairo, were thus raised by forced
labour. Mūlī Isma`īl, emperor of Morocco, who died, after a
long reign, in 1714, was a great lover of architecture and
employed many people on his buildings; if he did not approve
of the plan or the performance, it was usual for him to show the
delicacy of his taste by demolishing the whole structure and
putting to death all who had a hand in it.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_50'>50</a>.</em> “Providence would relieve him from the oppression
under which he suffered.”—Abū Saber said: “Be patient, since
the Almighty (may He be honoured and glorified!) is a friend of
the patient, and quickly will release thee from this oppression.”—Here,
it will be observed, Abū Saber refers to the text from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>Kur’ān quoted in the third note to this chapter, as above, “God
is with the patient.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_51'>51</a>.</em> “Supporting his head on the knees of patience,
implored the protection of the Almighty.”—Abū Saber may be
supposed to have assumed an attitude of prayer (<em>reka</em>), by an
inclination of the body, so that the hands rested on the knees,
saying (<em>tawakkal bar Khudā</em>), “put thy trust in God,” Kur’ān
xxxvii, 3; and recalling to mind: “whoso&nbsp;... persevereth
with patience shall at length find relief.”—Kur’ān xii, 90.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_51'>51</a>.</em> “It was resolved that they should go to the prison,
and propose three questions to the criminals confined there; and
that whoever gave the best answers should be chosen King.”—This
will probably strike most readers as a rather curious, not to
say hap-hazard, mode of electing a King; yet it goes, I think,
to prove the antiquity of the original story; and, moreover, if
the “questions” were of such a subtle nature as to require
superior sagacity for their solution, it may have been perhaps as
good a way of choosing a sovereign as many that have been
adopted either in ancient or modern times. The circumstance that
the test-questions were proposed to <em>prisoners</em> may seem still more
absurd; but the late King is represented as very tyrannical and
impious, “one who did not fear God, an infidel;” and the chiefs
of the city were doubtless aware that the prisoners were not
really criminals, but the innocent victims of a wicked tyrant.
It is very tantalising that neither in the lithographed text nor in
those texts which Lescallier made use of for his French translation,
nor in Sir William Ouseley’s, are the questions and Abū
Saber’s answers given. One is naturally curious to know
whether they were of the nature of ingenious riddles or subtle
questions involving profound moral truths. The practice
(apparently a very ancient one) of proposing to certain kinds of
candidates and accused persons, riddles or “hard questions” to
expound or answer is common to the popular fictions of Europe
as well as of Asia. In more than one of the Arabian Tales a lady
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>chooses for her husband him who answers her “questions.” In
the Scottish ballad of “Roslin’s Daughter” the lady proposes a
number of riddles or questions to her lover, which he must
answer before she will “gang to his bed.” In Mr Ralston’s
extremely entertaining and valuable <cite>Russian Folk-Tales</cite>, on the
other hand, a Princess makes it her rule, that “any one whose
riddles she cannot guess, him must she marry; but any one
whose riddles she can guess, him she may put to death.” In
Chapter 70 of Swan’s translation of the <cite>Gesta Romanorum</cite>, a
collection of Latin stories, largely derived from Eastern sources,
very popular in the Middle Ages, a King’s daughter vows that
she will never marry except the man who answers three questions.
In the old English version of the <cite>Gesta</cite>, edited by Sir Frederick
Madden, Chapter 19, a certain good and righteous knight is
falsely accused of some crime, and the Emperor gives him the
option of answering six questions or forfeiting his life. The same
story, with variations of local colouring, &amp;c., is found in the 4th
novel of Sacchetti, one of the early Italian novelists; in Tyl
Eulenspiegel, the celebrated German folk-book; and in our old
English ballad of “King John and the Abbot of Canterbury.”
In an Indian work of fiction, said to have been written in the
7th century, <cite>Dasa Kumara Charita</cite> (Adventures of Ten Princes),<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c014'><sup>[48]</sup></a>
Mitragupta meets with a terrible Rakshasa—a species of demon
in human form—who threatens to devour him if he cannot answer
four questions. These, with Mitragupta’s answers, are as follows:
(1) What is cruel? <em>Ans.</em> A wicked woman’s heart.
(2) What is most to the advantage of a householder? <em>Ans.</em>
Good qualities in a wife. (3) What is love? <em>Ans.</em> Imagination.
(4) What best accomplishes difficult things? <em>Ans.</em> Cunning.
Mitragupta then relates four stories in illustration of his answers.
In the Persian romance of <cite>Hatim Ta`ī</cite>—the author of which has
been greatly indebted to Hindū fiction for his materials—a young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>lady, named Husn Bānū, makes it the condition of her bestowing
her hand on any of her numerous suitors, that he shall answer
seven questions—or rather, perform seven difficult and dangerous
tasks in order to solve her questions.—In the 14th of Mr
Ralston’s <cite>Tibetan Tales</cite>,<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c014'><sup>[49]</sup></a> the Dumb Cripple, who does <em>not</em>
wish to succeed to the throne, is permitted to renounce the
world on condition of his answering three questions.—And
Voltaire, in his <cite>Zadig</cite>—imitating this feature of Oriental
romance, as he did others—represents a contention for the
throne of Babylon, first by a tournament, and finally by the
champions attempting to solve a number of enigmas.</p>

<p class='c009'>Whether it was ever a custom in any Eastern land to choose
a King from among prisoners to whom certain difficult questions
were proposed, is itself a “difficult question.” But it is remarkable
that in legendary Indian stories, both those preserved in
writing and by oral tradition, mention is frequently made of
the election of a King by the <em>elephant</em> of the deceased monarch.
For instance: in <cite>Sivandhi Sthala Purana</cite>, a legendary account
of the famous temple at Trinchinopoli, of which a palm-leaf
manuscript is described by Dr H. H. Wilson, in his Catalogue
of the Mackenzie Collection, it is related that a certain King
having mortally offended a holy Muni, his capital and all the
inhabitants were, in consequence of an imprecation pronounced
on him by the enraged saint, buried beneath a shower of dust.
“Only the Queen escaped, and in her flight she was delivered
of a male child. After some interval, the chiefs of the Chola
kingdom, proceeding to elect a King, determined, by advice of
the Muni [the same whose curse had worked the mischief aforesaid],
to crown whomsoever the late monarch’s elephant should
pitch upon. Being turned loose for that purpose, the elephant
discovered and brought to Trisira-mālī the child of his former
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>master, who accordingly became the Chola King.”<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c014'><sup>[50]</sup></a>—And
in the Manipuri Story of the Two Brothers, Turi and Basanta
(translated by G. H. Damant, in the <cite>Indian Antiquary</cite>, 1875),
Turi, in the course of his wanderings, is chosen King in a
similar manner by an elephant, who meets the youth in the
forest, takes him up, and brings him to the palace, where he
is immediately set upon the throne.—A very singular custom
in the election of a Khān seems to have been once observed by
the Kalmuks, if we may credit the <cite>Relations of Ssidi Kür</cite>,<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c014'><sup>[51]</sup></a>
a Tartar version of the Sanskrit <cite>Vetála Panchavinsati</cite>, or 25
Tales of a Demon: A sacred figure, of dough or paste, usually
in the shape of a pyramid, called a <em>baling</em>, was thrown high into
the air, and the person upon whose head it fell was proclaimed
Khān.—Still more curious, and savouring somewhat of the
supernatural;—in Mr Ralston’s <cite>Tibetan Tales</cite>, a king called
Ananda, being attacked by illness, considered which of his five
sons he should invest with the sovereign power. His four elder
sons were rash, rude, and hot-tempered; his youngest, Prince
Adarsamukha, was the most suitable; but Ananda’s kinsmen
would probably reproach him should he pass over the elder sons,
and give his crown to the youngest. Then said he to his
ministers: “Give ear, O chieftains! After my death ye are to
test each of the princes in turn. Him among them whom the
jewel-shoes fit when they are tried on; under whom the throne
remains steadfast when he is upon it; on whom the diadem rests
unshaken when it is placed upon his head; whom the women
recognise; and who guesses the six objects to be divined by his
insight, namely: the inner treasure, the outer treasure, the inner
and outer treasure, the treasure of the tree-top, the treasure of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>the hill-top, and the treasure of the river-shore: him by whom
all these conditions are fulfilled shall ye invest with the sovereign
power.” As is almost invariably the case in the folk-tales
of all countries, the youngest son is the successful competitor.—In
the good old times, when kings and chiefs were
chosen for their physical strength and prowess in battle, one can
see some propriety in rival candidates for the supreme power
settling their claims by a hand-to-hand contest; but surely only
in such countries as China and Japan could we conceive it
possible for a dispute of this kind to be settled <em>by proxy</em>. Mr
Mitford, in his <cite>Tales of Old Japan</cite> (vol. i, 203, 204), tells us:
“In the year 858 the throne of Japan was <em>wrestled for</em>. The
Emperor Buntoker had two sons, called Koréshito and Korétaka,
both of whom aspired to the throne. Their claims were decided
in a wrestling match, in which one Yoshirô was the champion
of Koréshito, and Natora the champion of Korétaka. Natora
having been defeated, Koréshito ascended his father’s throne,
under the style of Siewa.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_52'>52</a>.</em> “The robber he immediately recognised, but <em>was
silent</em>.”—In keeping with the Persian saying: <em>sina pur jūsh
o lab khamūsh</em>, “troubled breast and silent lip.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_52'>52</a>.</em> “We are freeborn, we are the sons of a Mussulmān—Slaves,
among the Muslims, are either captives in war
(<em>saqāyā</em>) or by purchase (<em>mavālāt</em>).” One of the fundamental
points of the Muhammadan religion consists in the ransom of
slaves: “Alms should buy the freedom of slaves”—Kurān
ix, 60.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_53'>53</a>.</em> “The merchant’s money to be deposited in the
public treasury.”—This, if correctly rendered, would have been
an act of gross injustice, not at all in accordance with the
character of Abū Saber; since the merchant had been guilty of
nothing unlawful in purchasing the boys, whom he did not
know were freeborn and the sons of a Muslim. The lithographed
text says: “He sent the robber to prison, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span><em>re-imbursed</em> the merchant from the public treasury;”—and
Lescallier (p. 96): “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il ordonna au voleur de <em>restituer</em> au
marchand l’argent qu’il en avait reçu, et le fit arrêter et jeter en
prison.</span>”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_53'>53</a>.</em> “Because she wore a veil (<em>sitr</em>).”—Muslim women
are prescribed by their religion to conceal from all men whatever
may be attractive in their appearance, and the men are not
permitted to see any unveiled women save their wives, or slaves,
and those women with whom they are prohibited by law from
marrying—see Kur’ān xxiv, 31. “The curse of God,” said
the Prophet, “is on the seer and the seen.” Lane, in his
<cite>Modern Egyptians</cite>, gives a very minute description, with
numerous engravings, of the veils worn by Muslim women, and
remarks that “the veil is of very remote antiquity”—see Genesis
xxiv, 65, and Isaiah iii, 23.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_53'>53</a>.</em> “Would not consent to perform the duties of a
wife.”—When a wife disobeys her husband’s lawful commands,
he may take her (or two Muslim witnesses) before the Kāzī.
Should the complaint preferred be just and proved, a certificate
is written, declaring her <em>nashiza</em>, rebellious, and the husband
is then quite free from the obligation of lodging, clothing, and
maintaining her.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_53'>53</a>.</em> “This man was not her husband.”—The 4th sura
of the Kur’ān (v. 20 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et seq.</span></i>) treats of lawful and unlawful
marriages. “Ye are all forbidden to take to wife free women
who are married” (v. 22); that is, says Sale, whether they be
Muslim women or not, unless they be legally divorced from
their husbands.—This incident, if the story be fictitious (but it
probably had some foundation in fact), is very ingeniously
conceived: Abū Saber’s happiness is rendered complete by the
recovery of his wife, with such a <em>credential</em> of her purity!</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c009'>The Arabian version of this story, according to Cazotte’s
French rendering (and Habicht’s German translation agrees
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>with it in this respect), gives a very different account of the
circumstances of Abū Saber’s elevation to the supreme power.
Abū Saber, it seems, had been cast by the wicked King into a
deep, dry well in the palace-yard. Now it happened that this
impious and cruel King “had a brother whom he had always
concealed from every eye, in a secret part of the palace; but
suspicion and uneasiness made him afraid lest he should one day
be carried off and placed upon the throne. Some time before
he had privately let him down into this well. This unhappy
victim of politics soon sank under so many distresses: he died;
but this event was not known, although the other parts of the
secret had transpired. The grandees of the realm, and the
whole nation, shocked at a capricious cruelty which exposed
them all to the same danger, rose, with one accord, against the
tyrant, and assassinated him. The adventure of Abū Saber had
been long since forgotten. One of the officers of the palace
reported that the King went every day to carry bread to a man
who was in the well, and to converse with him.<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c014'><sup>[52]</sup></a> This idea led
their thoughts to the brother who had been so cruelly used by
the tyrant. They ran to the well, went down into it, and found
there Abū Saber, whom they took for the presumptive heir to
the crown. Without giving him time to speak, or to make
himself known, they conducted him to a bath; and he was
soon clothed in the royal purple, and placed upon the throne.”</p>

<h3 class='c023'><span class='sc'>Notes on Chapter V.</span></h3>

<p class='c021'><em>Page <a href='#Page_56'>56</a>.</em> “The King of Yemen.”—As the Kings of Egypt
were named Pharaoh, those of the Sassanian dynasty of Persia,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>Khusrū, those of Abyssinia, Negashi, so were the Kings of
Yemen distinguished by the title of Tobba, from being the
paramount sovereign of a number of tribes or <em>followers</em> (<em>tābi`īn</em>).
Some of the ancient Kings, having considerably enlarged their
dominions by conquest, became proverbial for great power.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yemen (or <em>Arabia Felix</em>) in the time of Strabo was divided
into five kingdoms (l. 16, p. 112), and has been successively
subdued by the Abyssinians, the Persians, the Sultans of Egypt,
and the Turks.—On the west Yemen has the Red Sea; on the
south the Straits of Babu-’l-Mandab and the Indian Ocean; on
the east Hadramaut, and the north Nejed and the Hijāz. The
inhabitants plume themselves on their country being “the
birth-place of the sciences and religion” (<cite>Biladu-’l-`Ulm o
Biladu-’d-Dīn</cite>).—<cite>Niebuhr</cite>, par. ii, p. 247.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_56'>56</a>.</em> “A certain slave named Abraha.”—Influenced,
probably, by a malevolent feeling towards the <em>Mushriks</em> (those
who attribute partners to God—Christians), the Muslim author—or,
more likely, translator and adapter—gives the name of
Abraha to an Ethiopian slave, disparaging, as it were, the
historical fame of Abraha Ebnu-’s-Sabā, the 46th King of Yemen,
surnamed Sahibu-’l-Fīl (Lord of the Elephant), an Ethiopian by
birth, and of the Christian religion, who in paynim times built
a magnificent church in the citadel of Grandam, at Sanaā, with
the design of inducing pilgrims to resort thither, instead of to
the Ka`ba at Mecca. (See Kur’ān cv, and Sale’s <em>note</em>.)</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_56'>56</a>.</em> “The arrow cut off one of his ears.”—According to
Lescallier, only a piece of his ear.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_56'>56</a>.</em> “The King’s first impulse,” &amp;c.—In Lescallier’s
French rendering this passage is to the following effect: “The
King of Yemen at once ordered that Abraha should be seized
and beheaded. Abraha said to the King: ‘Your Majesty
knows that I am not blamable in this unfortunate affair; I shot
the arrow intending to wound the deer. If you pardon me this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>time, you, in your turn, will be pardoned when you sin.’ The
King of Yemen, having heard these words, received him favourably,
pardoned him, and cancelled the order which he had given.
Abraha was overjoyed at this, and they re-entered the town
together.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_57'>57</a>.</em> “They then returned to the city”—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i> Sanaā in
Yemen, so called to distinguish it from another Sanaā, a village of
Damascus, anciently called Azāl, from its founder. The city
is supposed to have acquired its name from the Ethiopians,
who conquered the country, and on beholding its beauty,
exclaimed: “This is Sana!” which in Ethiopic means, “commodious,”
“comfortable.”—At an elevation of 4000 feet above
the sea-level, near the source of the river Shāb, it is celebrated
for its trees and waters, and compared by `Abu-’l-Feda to
Damascus. The city is walled, as also the suburb, Birū-’l-Azāb.
At present it is a large mercantile town, the residence of an
Imām. A handsome bridge is thrown over the principal street,
down which flows a stream of water, and all the private dwellings
of the higher classes have glass windows, beautifully stained,
and are furnished with fountains. At the eastern and western
extremities is a castle, having each a palace, built of hewn stone,
covered with gray-coloured plaster. Situated in the heart of
the coffee country, the principal trade is in that useful berry,
which is rarely used for home consumption, the common
beverage being <em>keshr</em>, an infusion of the husk. About twenty
mosques, elaborately decorated, and with gilt domes, adorn
the city; and the public baths, numerous and good, are the
favourite resort of the merchants, who meet to discuss the state
of trade, and to listen to the news of the day, over a cup of
<em>keshr</em> and the indispensable <em>hūkka</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_57'>57</a>.</em> “Was driven on the coast of Zangībār (or Zanzibar).”—Probably
the ancient island of Menuthias, southward of
the Sea of Babu-’l-Mandab. This is the island of the “Zonūj”
mentioned in the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>, and they are also called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>“zinj” “zenj”—an Ethiopian nation of the country known to
us as Zangībār. (See Lane’s <cite>1001 Nights</cite>: “Abū Muhammad
the Lazy,” chap. xiv, text, p. 413, note 5.)—Zengī signifies
“black,” and <em>bār</em>, country or territory: Zangībār, “the country
of blacks.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_57'>57</a>.</em> The reader can hardly fail to observe very considerable
indistinctness (to say the least) in the narrative of the
incidents which immediately follow the return of the King of
Yemen and his slave Abraha to the capital. We are told,
“<em>they</em> then returned to the city; and after some time had
elapsed, <em>having gone on board a vessel</em>,” &amp;c.; from which it may
be naturally supposed that Abraha and the King were still in
company, although no mention is made of Abraha when the vessel
went to pieces. He turns up, however, very oddly, at page <a href='#Page_59'>59</a>:
“It happened that Abraha, who had been the King of Yemen’s
slave, was standing near this wall, but his former master did
not recognise him, as they had been separated for some time,
<em>Abraha having found means to return to Zangībār, his native
country</em>.” These last words, in italics, seem to represent a
passage, which the translator has strangely omitted in its proper
place, explaining the cause of the King of Yemen’s undertaking
a voyage by sea. The following is a translation of the events
which occurred after “they returned to the city” (p. <a href='#Page_57'>57</a>), according
to the lithographed text:</p>

<p class='c009'>A few days having elapsed, the King continued to be satisfied
with Abraha.—To return to the story.<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c014'><sup>[53]</sup></a> Ever since Abraha had
been absent from his father, messengers had been despatched in
every direction, and they had pursued [to] such [an extent]
research and inquiry, that it became known to them that Abraha
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>was in Yemen, and in the service of the King. The Shāh of
Zangībār was overjoyed, and took counsel of the Vizier, saying,
“What is the prudent plan [or proper policy—<em>tadbīr</em>] in this
affair?” The Vizier replied: “If the report should reach the
King of Yemen that he [Abraha] is the son of the Shāh of
Zangibār, the affair would be difficult.” In a word, this conversation
resulted in this resolve, that they should send an
intelligent person to bring back Abraha. This individual having
turned his face towards Yemen, arrived in the capital. He
employed considerable exertions in search of Abraha. When
he happened to meet with him, and the Khōja<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c014'><sup>[54]</sup></a> explained the
cause of his coming to Yemen, they both agreed to sally forth at
once from the city; and as soon as they were outside they set
their faces in the direction of Zangībār. Abraha had arrived
only a short time near his father, when the King of Yemen was
informed of the departure of Abraha, and he became morosely
pensive, and could take no rest. One day he commanded they
should equip vessels, [as] he wished to pass over the sea for the
purpose of being free from anxiety [or, of enjoying social intercourse].
When he was aboard the ship, and at some distance
from land, a hurricane sprang up suddenly, and shivered the
vessel to pieces. A portion of a plank was thrown against the
King of Yemen. Six days and nights he floated over the
surface of the sea, until he was cast ashore on the territory of
Zangistān;<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c014'><sup>[55]</sup></a> [certain] pearl-divers saw him; they approached
near him; they spoke a few words to him; he gave no response—he
was senseless. They sprinkled over his throat [and neck]
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>a quantity of oil of balsam; he opened his eyes, and his speech
came back to him. He asked them: “What territory is this?”
The divers replied: “This territory is Zangistān.” He then
asked: “How far is it to the capital?” They answered:
“Four parasangs.”<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c014'><sup>[56]</sup></a> The King of Yemen proceeded onwards,
until the hour of evening prayer, when he entered the city.</p>

<p class='c009'>Manuscripts of the <cite>Bakhtyār Nāma</cite> vary so much in detail
that probably no two are exactly the same. Those used by M.
Lescallier would appear to have been more diffuse than the
lithographed text of 1839. According to his rendering, after
the King of Zangībār’s messenger had been some time in
Yemen, “he chose a fitting occasion and place to see Abraha,
and converse with him. He spoke to him of his country, of
his father, and of the love which he had for his dear son, like
that which Jacob bore to his beloved son, Joseph.<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c014'><sup>[57]</sup></a> Abraha,
hearing news of his country and his father, felt his sensibility
re-awaken; his eyes shed gentle tears, like the showers of
spring, and he spoke these words, interrupted by sobs: ‘Whence
come you, my dear sir? How and for what purpose are you
arrived in this country?’ The messenger then confided to him
the secret reason of his journey,<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c014'><sup>[58]</sup></a> undertaken for the sole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>purpose of bringing him back to his father. Abraha asked him
urgently to take him away from that town. The messenger,
who was a very intelligent and clever man, took his measures
and time so well that he carried off Abraha, and made him
start with him for that capital, and they arrived without accident
at Zangībār. As soon as they were near the outskirts of the
capital of Zangībār, the King, being informed of the arrival of
his son, sent some people to meet him, and caused him to be
escorted with pomp, and he received him with demonstrations
of the greatest joy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>According to M. Cazotte’s rendering (<em>King Bohetzad</em>, &amp;c.)
of this story, under the rather misleading title of “Baharkan, or
the Intemperate Man,” Abraha was not a slave but an officer,
and his name was Tirkan. “He was,” we read, “a young
prince who had fled from his father’s court in order to escape
the punishment of a fault which he had committed.  After
having wandered unknown from country to country, he at length
settled at the Court of King Baharkan, where he obtained
employment.  He still remained there some time after the
accident which had befallen him [to wit, the accident to the
King’s ear]. But his father, having discovered the place of his
retreat, sent him his pardon, and conjured him to return to him.
He did this in such affectionate and paternal terms that Tirkan,
trusting in his father’s goodness, immediately departed. His
hopes were not deceived, and he was re-established in all his
rights.” The sequel agrees for the most part with that of the
Persian text; only we are told that the King’s object in going
over sea was pearl-fishing for amusement.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_57'>57</a>.</em> “Sheltered himself under the shade (<em>sāyabān</em>) of a
merchant’s house.”—<em>Sāyabān</em>, a canopy; an umbrella; a shade
formed by foliage, or any other projection. Against the front
of shops in Eastern countries is a raised bench, or rather a stone
or brick platform (<em>mastaba</em>), two feet from the ground, upon
which the tradesman sits, and a little above it is a covering
(<em>sakīfat</em>) of matting; and sometimes planks supported by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>beams, affording shelter and shade.  (See Lane’s <cite>Modern
Egyptians</cite>, vol. ii, pp. 9, 10.)</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_58'>58</a>.</em> “He was sent to prison”—Lescallier’s rendering
adds, “where he passed his time praising God, and submitting
to His will.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_59'>59</a>.</em> “He gave public audience to persons of all ranks”
<em>khāss o `amin</em>—noble and plebeian.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_59'>59</a>.</em> “If I succeed in hitting that crow (properly,
<em>raven</em>),” &amp;c.—The superstitious belief in divination from the
flight, motions, and positions of birds (<em>ez-zijr</em>, <em>el-īyafa</em>), which
prevailed so much among the Arabs at the time when the
Prophet began his great mission, although it is denounced by
the Kur’ān, prevails even now in the East, where the raven is
called the “Father of Omens” (<em>Abū-Zājir</em>), and the “Bird
of Separation” (<em>ghurabi-’l-bain</em>); its appearance betokening a
change of circumstances, which for the King of Yemen denoted
liberty from a state of slavery. According to an author cited by
Bochart (<cite>Hier.</cite> i, p. 20), Noah sent forth from the ark a raven,
to observe whether the water had abated, and it did not return,
hence it is called “the bird of separation.” In the <cite>Gulistān</cite>,
iv, 12, an execrable voice is compared to the croak of the Raven
of Separation, or, as some render the passage, “the raven of ill
omen” (see Lane’s Arabic Lexicon, vol. i). Ravens in many
countries have been considered as birds of ill omen. Thus, in
Dryden’s <cite>Virgil</cite>:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The hoarse raven on the blasted bough,</div>
      <div class='line'>By croaking to the left, presaged the coming blow;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>and in Gay’s <cite>Fables</cite> (xxxvii, 27, 28):</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>That raven on yon left-hand oak,</div>
      <div class='line'>Curse on his ill-betiding croak.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_59'>59</a>.</em> “The law of retaliation, which would not award a
head for an ear.”—In accordance with the text of the Kur’ān,
v, 49: “We have therein commanded them that they should
give life for life, and eye for eye, and <em>ear for ear</em>, and tooth for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>tooth; and that wounds should also be punished by retaliation,”
&amp;c. (compare Exod. xxi, 24; Levit. xxiv, 20; Deut. xix, 21).
For unintentional mutilation the Muhammadan law permits
the payment of half the price of blood, as for homicide; for a
member of which there are two, from the rich man 500 dīnars
(£250), from the less opulent 6000 direms (£150). The delinquent
in the present instance, being penniless, the King of
Zangībār had no choice but to exact “ear for ear.” (Sale’s
<cite>Kur’ān</cite>, Prel. Disc., sec. vi; Mills’ <cite>History of Muhammedanism</cite>,
ed. 1817, pp. 319, 320.)</p>

<h3 class='c023'><span class='sc'>Notes on Chapter VI.</span></h3>

<p class='c021'><em>Page <a href='#Page_62'>62</a>.</em> “Represented the danger of letting an enemy live
when in one’s power.”—This unmerciful suggestion<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c014'><sup>[59]</sup></a> ill accords
with the humane precept of Hūshung, an early King of Persia,
surnamed Pīshdād (the First Distributor of Justice), and dictated
by him to Tahmuras, the heir apparent: “The sovereign extends
the skirt of pardon and the robe of clemency over those
who have erred;&nbsp;... acting according to this injunction:
When thou hast prevailed over thy foe, pardon him, in gratitude
for the power obtained over him. ‘Bind him,’ says the poet,
‘with the chains of forgiveness, that he may become your
slave.’”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_62'>62</a>.</em> “Advised him not to be precipitate.”—With more
eloquence does a falsely accused lady plead to her husband in
the <cite>Anvār-i Suhailī</cite> (p. 243 of Eastwick’s translation): “The
wise think deliberation requisite in all affairs, especially in
shedding blood, since if it be necessary to take life, the opportunity
of doing so is left; and if—which God forbid!—they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>should, through precipitation, put an innocent person to death,
and it should afterwards be known that he did not deserve to be
slain, the remedy would be beyond the circle of possibility, and
the punishment thereof would hang to all eternity on the neck
of the guilty party.” And elsewhere in the same charming
work we are told that “the heart of a King ought to be like
the billowy sea, so as not to be discoloured by the dirt and
rubbish of calumny; and the centre of his clemency should be
like the stately mountain, firm in a position of stability, so that
the furious wind of anger cannot move it.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_62'>62</a>.</em> King Dādīn, or Dādiyān—a title formerly given to
the Persian Kings of the first, or Pīshdādian, dynasty, and in a
later age assumed also by the Princes of Mingrelia. (<cite>Chardin</cite>,
vol. i, p. 82.)</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_62'>62</a>.</em> Kārdār signifies busy, a money lender, a prime
minister, and is a compound of <em>kār</em>, work, occupation, and
<em>dār</em>, possessing, lord, master.—Kāmgār is composed of <em>kām</em>,
desire, wish, and <em>gār</em>, a particle which, subjoined to a word,
denotes agency.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_63'>63</a>.</em> “Having reason to believe her father would not
consent to bestow her on him.”—The text runs thus: “He
said to himself, ‘Kāmgār is an ascetic (<em>zāhid</em>) and a religious
man (<em>pārsā</em>), and would not give me his daughter.’”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_64'>64</a>.</em> “Begged permission to inform his daughter”—the
text adds, “and, in conformity with the law of Muhammad
(<em>sharī`at</em>), obtain her consent.”—This is a proof that the lady
had attained marriageable age, as the consent of a girl not
arrived at the age of puberty is not required.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_64'>64</a>.</em> “Related to her all that had passed.”—The text:
“The daughter said, ‘I am not worthy of the King; besides,
once in the King’s service, I cannot [devote myself to the] worship
[of] God the Most High; and for the least fault the King
would punish me.’”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span><em>Page <a href='#Page_65'>65</a>.</em> “Sent her to his palace (<em>sarāy-harem</em>), and
appointed servants—<em>besides a cook</em>.” Here there is a very
remarkable difference between Ouseley’s and the lithographed
texts, and between these again and Lescallier and Habicht.
This is what the lithographed text says: “And in the service
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i> [of the late vizier Kāmgār] there was a good man (<em>khayyir</em>)
who had acted as a spiritual guide (<em>buzurg</em>), whom the King
did not admit in the harem. This holy person, who had been
constantly at the side of the daughter, wrote a letter [to this
effect]: ‘Do thou confirm the reward of service, and speak to
the King about my wish [in order] that he may admit me
into thy service, [seeing] that I should perish from disappointment.’
... (the King gave his consent)&nbsp;...
and the daughter continued her devotions in peace and tranquillity.”
Thus, in place of a <em>cook</em>, as in our version, the
lithographed text has, more appropriately, <em>a holy man</em>: but in
Lescallier and in Habicht, this person is, strange to say, a
jester, or merry-andrew—<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouffon</span></i>—<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">lustigmacher!</span></i>—while in
Cazotte’s rendering of the Arabic version, and in the Turkī
version of this story (a translation of which is appended to the
present notes), he is simply described as a <em>slave</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_66'>66</a>.</em> Discovered her sitting alone on the balcony (<em>bālkhāna</em>),
viz. a latticed window on the <em>upper storey</em> of the harem—hence
our word “balcony.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_66'>66</a>.</em> “Kārdār, fearing lest she should relate to the King
what had passed,” &amp;c.—Although many Oriental stories—Indian,
Persian, Arabian—are designed to show the malice
and craft of women, there are yet some, and the present tale is
an example, in which men, when foiled in their attempts upon
the chastity of women, are exhibited as equally adroit and
unscrupulous. Another instance occurs in the <cite>Anvar-iSuhailī</cite>,
ii, 10, where a beautiful and virtuous wife is described
in verses which are also applicable to the Vizier’s daughter of
our story:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>To worldly matters she had closed her eye,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sate curtained by the veil of chastity;</div>
      <div class='line'>E’en to the glass her form would not display,</div>
      <div class='line'>And from her shadow sank, alarmed, away.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>This lady’s husband had a slave, who cast the eye of desire
upon her, and “when he despaired of success, as is the wont of
evil men, he determined to assail her reputation, and employ a
stratagem to secure her disgrace.” So he buys two parrots, and
teaches them to say that the lady had been unfaithful to her
husband; but he fails in his diabolical scheme.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_67'>67</a>.</em> “He addressed her with the usual salutation,
which she returned.”—That is: <em>Es-salāmu `alaykum</em>, “Peace
be on you!” to which she replied: <em>`Alaykum es-salām</em>. But
the lady devotee would probably “salute with a better salutation,”
in accordance with the Kur’ān, iv, 88: “When ye
are saluted with a salutation, salute the person with a better
salutation, or at least, return the same.” “A better salutation”—that
is, by adding <em>rahmatu-`llāhi wa barakātuh</em>, “and the
mercy of God and His blessings!” In saluting a co-religionist,
this addition is obligatory.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_67'>67</a>.</em> “It was a maxim of the wise men: When you
have killed the serpent, you should also kill its young.”—Can
this “maxim” have been borrowed from Sa`di, who says
(<cite>Gulistān</cite>, i, 4): “To extinguish a fire and leave the
embers, or to kill a viper and preserve its young, is not the
act of wise men?” If so, this work, in its present form, must
have been composed after the 13th century.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_68'>68</a>.</em> “Ordered the unfortunate cook to be instantly cut
in two.”—A horrible mode of putting a culprit to death, and
peculiar, it is said, to the criminal law of Persia.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_69'>69</a>.</em> “Being dissuaded by an attendant from killing a
woman.”—The Persians seldom put women to death, as the
shedding of their blood is supposed to bring misfortune on the
country. But when found guilty and condemned, the injunction
prescribed by the law, of another man’s wife never being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>seen unveiled, is strictly respected, by conducting the culprit,
enveloped in the veil habitually worn by her, to the summit of a
lofty tower, and throwing her thence headlong.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_68'>68</a>.</em> “Was turned into the dreary wilderness.”—In
Indian Fairy Tales daughters who offend their fathers are
frequently sent into the desert. For instance, in the Romance
of the Four Dervishes (the Hindū version, <cite>Bāgh o Bahār</cite>), a king
has seven daughters, and one day he impiously tells them that
all their good fortune depends upon his life. Six of them
profess to agree with him in this sentiment; but the seventh,
and youngest, who has more sense and judgment than the
others, dissents, saying that the destinies of every one are with
oneself. The king, on hearing this, became angry. The
reply displeased him highly, and he said in wrath: “What
great words issue from a little mouth! Now let this be your
punishment, that you strip off whatever jewels she has on her
hands and feet, and let her be placed in a litter and set down in
a wilderness, where no human traces are found; then shall we
see what is written in her destinies.”  She is accordingly
carried into the desert, where she offers up fervent prayers to
Heaven, and falls asleep. In this way, praying and sleeping,
she passed three days without food or water, until on the fourth
day a hermit appears, who relieves her wants, and, to be brief,
she discovers a hidden treasure, causes a magnificent palace to
be erected, and sends for her parents and sisters, who are naturally
confounded at her good fortune. In like manner, Husn Bānū,
in the <cite>Romance of Hatim Ta`ī</cite>, having justly accused a Dervish,
who was a favourite of the King, of robbing her house, is
expelled from the city, and in the desert she discovers, through
a dream, the hidden treasure of the Seven Regions, underneath
a tree.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_68'>68</a>.</em> “Resigned herself to the will of Providence, conscious
of her own innocence.”—The text states that she said
this prayer: “O God! Creator! thou knowest I am innocent;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>if Thou hast foreordained<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c014'><sup>[60]</sup></a> that I should die, vouchsafe at
least a little water [inflow] in my mouth, that my tongue may
testify to thine incomparable unity.” The text also says that
when the fountain of water sprang up, she “performed the
ablution” (prescribed by the Kur’ān), and “stood up in
prayer.” This seems to imply that she turned her face towards
the <em>Kibla</em> (that is, Mecca), and went through the different
postures of prayer.—See Lane’s <cite>Modern Egyptians</cite>, chapter iii.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_69'>69</a>.</em> “The camel placed himself so as to afford her
a shade from the sunbeams.”—Although our author was, no
doubt, a pious believer in this miracle, including the part that
was played in it by the camel, yet it can only appear ludicrous
to Europeans, and those who have had the good fortune to read,
either in the original Telūgū, or in Babington’s translation, the
<cite>Adventures of the Gūrū Paramartan</cite>, will probably be
reminded by this of the story of the Gūrū, who, having hired
an ox to ride upon, reposed under the shade of the animal
during the heat of the day, and the owner demanded additional
pay, alleging that he did not lend his ox as an umbrella against
the sun’s rays. The case was referred to the head-man of a
village, who, after relating a somewhat similar case within his
own experience, decided as follows: “For journeying hither
on the ox, the proper hire is money; and for remaining in the
ox’s shadow, the <em>shadow of the hire-money</em> is sufficient.”<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c014'><sup>[61]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span><em>Page <a href='#Page_69'>69</a>.</em> “It happened that one of the King’s camel-keepers,”
&amp;c.—According to the text, “had lost a <em>katar</em> of
camels,” that is, several linked together, and following one
another.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_69'>69</a>.</em> “At his request she prayed for the recovery of the
camels.”—The text says: “The daughter, having raised her
face towards heaven, said, ‘O God! Creator! thou knowest
that these camels are not his own, and that he is a hired
labourer (<em>muzdar</em>), but now is without resource and afflicted,
through thy loving kindness and bounty, [be pleased to] restore
to him the camels.’” Muhammadans often implore the intercession
of saints (and the cameleer, of course, believed the
lady to be nothing short of a saint), both living and dead, on
their behalf. To be worthy of the dignity of a true saint
requires self-denial, mortification, a perfect reliance on Providence,
and the keeping aloof from the habitations of men; above
all, that, while professing the unity of God (<em>lā ilāha illa-’llāh</em>),
no living creature should see their lips move. Lane, in a note
to his translation of the <cite>Thousand and One Nights</cite> (ch. xi,
n. 37) states that “the Sayyida Nafīsa, the great-grandaughter
of the Imām El-Hasan, was a very celebrated saint; and
many miracles are related to have been performed by her. Her
tomb, which is greatly venerated, is in a mosque in the southern
suburb of Cairo.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_70'>70</a>.</em> “He would provide for her a retired apartment,”
&amp;c.—The text reads: “I will prepare an oratory (<em>sawma`ā</em>),
and make ready for thy sake the means (<em>asbāb</em>: furniture) for
devotion (<em>asbāb-i-`ībāda</em>);” such as a prayer-carpet (<em>sajjāda</em>),
having a mark upon it pointing towards Mecca, the <em>Kibla</em> of
Muslims, or point to which they direct their faces in saying
their prayers, as Jerusalem is that of the Jews and Christians:
within the mosque it is shown by a niche, and is called <em>El-Mihrāb</em>.
The hypocritical saint is thus described by Sa`dī
(<cite>Gulistān</cite> ii, 17):</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>There should also be a fountain of running water (for ceremonial
ablution) and a copy of the Kur’ān.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_70'>70</a>.</em> “Arrived at the city at the time of evening
prayer.”—It is incumbent on every good Muslim (says Dr
Forbes, in a note to his translation of <cite>Bāgh o Bahār</cite>) to pray
five times in the 24 hours. The stated periods are rather
capriciously settled: (1) The morning prayer is to be repeated
between daybreak and sunrise; (2) The prayer of noon, when
the sun shows a sensible declination from the meridian; (3)
afternoon prayer, when the sun is so near the horizon that the
shadow of a perpendicular object is twice its length; (4)
evening prayer, between sunset and close on twilight; (5) the
prayer of night, any time during darkness.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_71'>71</a>.</em> “She begged that he would conceal himself in
the apartment whilst she should converse with Kārdār.”—This, it
seems to me, is quite after the manner of a modern European
play or novel—when the “villain” is made to unmask himself,
by a pious <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ruse</span></i> of “injured innocence.” I cannot call
to mind a similar scene in any other Eastern romance which I
have read.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_72'>72</a>.</em> “Concealed behind the hangings” (see also
p. <a href='#Page_67'>67</a>, line 8 from foot).—The use of hangings, pictured
tapestry, and various coloured carpets has been from the
earliest ages prevalent in the East. We read in the
Book of Esther, chapter i, &amp;c., of the magnificence of a
Persian monarch, who made a feast unto his nobles of Persia
and Media, and in his palace had hangings, white, green,
and red, fastened with purple cords to silver rings, with beds
of gold and silver; and Plutarch, in Themistocles, speaks of the
rich Persian carpets, with highly-coloured figures; and in his
life of Cato the Censor, he mentions some Babylonian tapestry
sent to Rome as a present. The manufacture passed in very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>early times from Asia into Greece, part of which, indeed, was
itself Asiatic. Iris found Helen employed on figured tapestry,
and the web of Penelope is sufficiently known (<cite>Iliad iii</cite>).—Sir

<p class='c009'>This story of King Dādīn and his Two Viziers is, perhaps,
the best of the whole series; and it will doubtless interest the
general reader to see a Turkī version of it, according to a
unique manuscript, preserved in the Bodleian Library at
Oxford, written, in 1434, in the Uygur language and characters,<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c014'><sup>[62]</sup></a>
of which mention is made in the Second Section of the <span class='sc'>Introduction</span>.
M. Jaubert, who wrote an account of this manuscript
in the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal Asiatique</span></cite>, tom. x, 1827, remarks, that,
“apart from the interest which the writing and phraseology of
the work might possess for those who study the history of
languages, it is rather curious for the history of manners to see
how a Tātār translator sets to work to bring within the range of
his readers stories embellished in the original with descriptions
and images familiar, doubtless, to a learned and refined nation
like the Persians, but foreign to shepherds.” The following
rendering of M. Jaubert’s translation of the Turkī version of
“King Dādīn and his Two Viziers” is, I believe, the first that
has yet appeared in English.</p>

<h4 class='c020'>HISTORY OF THE FIFTH DAY.</h4>

<p class='c021'>One of the Vezīrs advanced and said: “O King! command
that they put this slave to death, for all the people murmur,
indignant at his crime, and we ourselves are grieved at such a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>rumour.” Then the King commanded, and they made Bakhtyār
approach, and he said to him: “Slave, wherefore madest
thou that attempt? Of a truth I will not spare thee this day.”
Bakhtyār replied: “O King, I am innocent, and I look from
the Divine pity that thou deliver me from these bonds, in like
manner as the guiltless bride of the King Dādīn was delivered
from hers.” The King said: “What befell that woman?”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was in Tātāristan (answered Bakhtyār), a King who had
a beautiful wife and two Vezīrs.<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c014'><sup>[63]</sup></a> One of these Vezīrs was
called Kerdār, the other Kārdān.<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c014'><sup>[64]</sup></a> Kerdār was father of a
maiden of beauty so perfect that one could not find in the whole
world anything to vie with it; and she was so pious that not
only did she recite the Kur’ān all day, but she passed the nights
in prayer. Impressed by the greatness of her devotion, King
Dādīn became enamoured of this maiden without having seen
her, and he demanded her of her father in marriage, and he
promised to advise her. He did so, but she replied: “Passing
my life in prayer, I cannot agree to become a great lady, and my
ambition is limited to the service of God.” The Vezīr reported
these words to the King, who, in the greatness of his
anger, put him to death. Then he caused the maiden to be
brought to the palace, and he said to her: “I desire to raise
thee to the dignity of a princess; during the day thou shalt
pray to God here, during the night thou shalt serve me.” Just
then there arrived a courier, bearing important letters. The
King ordered the maiden to pray for him; he confided the care
of his city to his Vezīr Kārdān; and having mounted his horse,
with a party of his nobles, went forth.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>One day, when the Vezīr was repeating his prayers, his eyes
fell upon the maiden. Dazzled by the splendour of her beauty,
he became suddenly enamoured of her, and approached her and
said: “O maiden, I am enamoured of thee; if thou fearest
God have pity on my sufferings and reward my love!” The
lady replied: “The King, in his trust, has left thee in his
house, and thou seekest to make me betray him! Take heed
that thou commit not this evil deed;—suffer not thyself to be
taken in the snares of Satan for a woman, and think not that
all of my sex are in nature alike. I pardon thee thy sin—beware
of rushing on thy ruin.” When the Vezīr heard these words he
perceived that he could not succeed in his design. Then he
repented of his conduct, and said within himself: “If the King
learns of this event, he will kill me; so let me invent some
stratagem which will bring about the maiden’s ruin instead of
mine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now the Vezīr, father of the lady, had brought from his
native country a slave who had been brought up with her, and
in whose company she was accustomed to live.<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c014'><sup>[65]</sup></a> When the
King had finished his campaign, and returned [to his capital],
he called the Vezīr before him, and asked of all that had happened
during his absence, and particularly about the lady. The
Vezīr said: “O King! I have something to say, and yet I
dare not.” “Speak,” replied the King: “I know that thou
art a good and faithful minister, and that thou canst not betray
the truth.” Then the Vezīr replied: “Some one told me that a
slave, brought from his native country by the father of that
maiden, had had guilty connection with her. At first I regarded
this imputation as a slander. ‘What is that?’ said I to myself.
‘The King loves that lady, so that with her the sorrows of this
world seem light to him. Besides, if the fault had been committed,
there would be witnesses—the thing cannot be.’ One
day, however, an [other] individual sought me out, to bring me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>to see what was being done by the favourite of the King. I
went, I listened, I recognised the maiden’s voice, and that of the
slave. She was saying to him: ‘In thus dishonouring me as
thou hast done, thou hast put me in danger of perishing like my
father, whose death I [involuntarily] caused. I must be thy
portion.’ The slave replied: ‘But what is thy intention concerning
the King?’ The maiden answered: ‘He must be
killed by means of some stratagem; if we work well together we
shall succeed in our design. Take thou measures concerning the
King;—kill him, for he has slain my father unjustly, and I am
bound to take vengeance.’ When I heard these words,” continued
the Vezīr, “I felt my body tremble. The reality of the
fact was made clear to me, as it was to the person who had
informed me. Now it is yours, O King, to know what ought to
be done.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When the King heard this story he was very angry. He
caused the slave’s head to be cut off. He called the maiden
before him, and asked what words she had used, and cruelly
reproached her, for that, after being overwhelmed with honours,
she had dared to conceive so guilty a design. She replied:
“O King, deign to give full trust to my words, and if thou
fearest God, slay me not on the report of my most cruel
enemies.” But far from believing her sincerity, the King
ordered his favourite to be put to death. Happily, this Prince
had a faithful slave, who showed to him how the murder of a
woman were a shameful deed; that it was enough to have
killed her accomplice; that it were better to banish that
unhappy woman to some wilderness far from the dwellings of
man, where she must inevitably perish; and that at least by
refraining from staining his hands with her blood, he should be
doing an action pleasing to God. So the King ordered an old
woman to mount the maiden upon a camel, to take her to a
lonely desert and leave her there, and this was forthwith done.
And so that hapless one was left in the wilderness, with no
other aid than the Divine compassion.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>This desert lay on the boundaries of the realms of the King of
Persia, one of whose cameleers<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c014'><sup>[66]</sup></a> had lost a camel. He was
seeking it vainly on every side, when suddenly he perceived
a beautiful lady praying to God. Fearing to disturb her, the
cameleer waited till she had finished her prayers, when he went
up to her, saluted her, and asked her who she was. “I am,”
said she, “a poor, weak handmaid of God.” “Who has
brought thee here?” continued the cameleer. She replied:
“God.” Then the cameleer said within himself: “This lady
is indeed favoured with the grace of the Most High.” He said
to her: “I am in the service of the King of Persia; if thou
desirest, I shall marry thee, and have for thee the greatest
regard.” “I cannot consent thereto,” replied she; “but for
the love of God, lead me to some inhabited spot, where I may
find water, and I will remember thee in my prayers.” The
cameleer complied with her request; he mounted the maiden
upon his camel, led her to a village, confided her to the care of
the head-man of the village till he should return; and set
out in quest of the camel he had lost, which he immediately
found—a good fortune which he attributed to the maiden’s
prayers.</p>

<p class='c009'>He gave thanks therefor to God, and returned to the King
of Persia, to whom he spoke of the maiden’s beauty, piety, and
of all the perfections with which she was adorned. “Such a
lady,” said the King, “would suit well to be my wife.”
Thereupon he mounted his horse, and with a great number
of his servants proceeded to the village. When he saw the
lady he was filled with admiration, and he said to her: “Maiden,
I am the King of Persia; be my bride, and I will care for
thee with the greatest of care.” “O King!” replied
she, “may the Divine favour increase thy prosperity! Thou
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>possessest a great number of women; and as for me, I have no
need of a husband; for the love of God appears to me more
desirable than the whole world.” And she continued her
prayers. Then the King gave orders that his tents should be
erected in that spot, and that they should cut there channels of
running water; and he remained there some days. At the
end of that time, moved by the sweet words and piety of the
maiden, but hurried by the affairs of state, he mounted her in
a litter, led her to his capital, gave her apartments in his own
kiosk, and having ordered preparations for a brilliant nuptial
feast, he married her. After that he gave her great riches,
beautiful clothes, many servants, and a splendid palace. One
night this lady related her adventures to the King of Persia;
and on the morrow that prince assembled a vast army, set out,
and took prisoner the King Dādīn, the Vezīr Kārdān, and
also the faithful servant to whom the lady owed her life. She
called King Dādīn before her, and said to him: “Though I
was innocent and true, thou sentest me into a desert to die; but
God has had compassion upon me, and has brought thee
hither to me, loaded with chains.” Then addressing the Vezīr
Kārdān, she said: “How is it that thou hast allowed thyself to
be taken in the snare which thou didst prepare for me?” The
Vezīr replied: “O maiden! thou wast not guilty, and all that
I said was a lie; therefore hath God punished me!”
“Praise be to Him!” replied the lady, “for He has granted
that I should live, and that people should know my innocence!
For the rest, I desire that they who slew my father should
receive their due reward.” So the King of Persia ordered the
Vezīr to be taken to the same desert whither the maiden had
been sent. There he died of hunger and thirst. King Dādīn
was beheaded as a punishment for the murder he had committed;
and his dominions were given to the faithful servant
[whose good advice aided the safety, the innocence, and the
triumph of virtue].</p>

  <h3 class='c023'><span class='sc'>Notes on Chapter VII.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c021'><em>Page <a href='#Page_72'>72</a>.</em> “Your Majesty can easily put to death a living
man, but you cannot restore a dead man to life.”—Here again
(see note on page <a href='#Page_184'>184</a>) we have what seems to be an instance of
borrowing from Sa`dī, who, in his <cite>Gulistān</cite>, viii, maxim 54,
thus finely expresses this sentiment (Professor Eastwick’s translation):</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>’Tis very easy one alive to slay;</div>
      <div class='line'>Not so to give back life thou tak’st away:</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Were it possible, we might suppose that our English poet
Cowley had simply paraphrased these couplets of Sa`dī in the
following verses:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Easy it was the living to have slain,</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_74'>74</a>.</em> “Women, for their own purposes, often devise
falsehoods, and are very expert in artifice and fraud.”—It was a
saying of Muhammad that “women are deficient in judgment
and religion,” which induces their co-religionists of the other
sex to believe that they are more inclined than men to practise
whatever is unlawful. When woman was created, the Devil,
we are told, was delighted, and said: “Thou art half of my
host, and thou art the depositary of my secret, and thou art my
arrow, with which I shoot, and miss not.”<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c014'><sup>[68]</sup></a> The Turkish Tales
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>of the Forty Viziers (another romance of the <cite>Sindibād</cite> cycle—see
<span class='sc'>Introduction</span>) chiefly refer to the craft and malice of
women. In the present story, however, female artifice is not
employed for wicked ends.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_74'>74</a>.</em> “The King of `Irāk.”—There are two `Irāks;
one is a division of Arabia to the south of the Tigris and the
Euphrates. Towards the north-east it is watered by the
branches of the Euphrates, and is consequently fertile and well
inhabited, having many cities and towns, of which Basra is the
principal; to the south-west it is a barren desert. By Orientals
it is called `Irāk `Arabi, to distinguish it from the other `Irāk,
(`Irāk `Ajami) a province of Persia, bounded on the north by
Ghilān and Mazinderān, on the east by Khurāsān, on the south
by Farsistān, and on the west by `Irāk `Arabi. This province
contains part of ancient Media and Parthia. It is nearly a
hundred and fifty leagues in length, and one hundred and
twenty in breadth; partly mountainous and sterile, having vast
sandy plains; but the greater part fruitful and populous.
Isfahān is the capital.<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c014'><sup>[69]</sup></a> It is of Persian `Irāk that the poet
Nizāmī thus speaks:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>

      <div class='line'>`Irāk, the delightful, be thy darling,</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_74'>74</a>.</em> Abyssinia, or Habashat (that is, “a mixture,” or
“confusion”), forms an extensive country of Eastern Africa, the
boundaries of which are not well defined. The natives call
their country Manghesta Ityopia, or Kingdom of Ethiopia.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_75'>75</a>.</em> “When they disclosed the object of their mission,
he became angry”—at the presumption of an unbeliever (who
attributed partners to God) asking in marriage the daughter of
one of the faithful. The conversion of Abyssinia to Christianity
was prior to the fourth and continued even as late as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>twelfth century. The Coptic patriarch of Cairo is still the
nominal head of the Church, but the episcopal office is confined
to the Abūnā, the resident head, and author, of the Abyssinian
priesthood.—<em>Gibbon.</em></p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_76'>76</a>.</em> “Caused so much money to be distributed among
the soldiers that they were satisfied.”—So says Sa`dī, <cite>Gulistān</cite>
i, 14 (Eastwick’s translation):</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>

    <div class='group'>

</div>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_77'>77</a>.</em> “The King of `Irāk had some years previously
given his daughter in marriage to another man, by whom she
had a son.”—This concealment of a former marriage is incomprehensible.
Lescallier’s French rendering, made from other
Persian texts, gives a different account of this affair: “She
had had previously a lover, with whom, <em>unknown to her father</em>,
she had intimate relations, and had given birth to a beautiful
boy, whose education she secretly confided to some trusty
servants.” Afterwards the Princess of `Irāk contrived to introduce
him to her father, who was so charmed with his beauty,
grace of manner, and varied accomplishments, that he at once
took him into his service. Habicht’s Breslau edition of the
Arabian version agrees with Lescallier on this point. In the
version of this story in the <cite>Tūtī Nāma</cite> (Tales of a Parrot) of
Nakshabī,<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c014'><sup>[70]</sup></a> the lady is the daughter of the Emperor of Rūm
(see Note, p. <a href='#Page_158'>158</a>), and, as in our text, had a son by a former
marriage, about whose existence her father charges her not to
say a word to her second husband.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span><em>Page <a href='#Page_78'>78</a>.</em> “The name of the boy was Farrukh-zād”—that
is, “fortunately-born”; from <em>farrukh</em>, happy, fortunate, and
<em>zād</em>, born.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_81'>81</a>.</em> “An old woman beheld the Queen, as she sat
alone, weeping.”—In Eastern fiction old women—and especially
hypocritical devotees—are useful go-betweens for lovers,
and excellent, prudent procuresses. In the present case, however,
the old woman plays an unusual <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</span></i>: employing her sage
experience and skill in reconciling husband and wife.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_82'>82</a>.</em> “I have a certain talisman,” &amp;c.—The word
<em>talism</em> is not in the lithographed text; the sentence is to this
effect: “I have that which is precious, and possesses the same
magical power as the precious things of Solomon, written in
Greek characters and in the Syrian language”—which means,
Syrian words disguised under the letters of the Greek alphabet.
Among the Arabs and Persians it is a common belief that
Solomon, the son of David, by virtue of a seal-ring (<em>Muhr-i-Sulaymāni</em>)
sent down from heaven, had unlimited control over
the good and evil spirits (<em>jinn</em>), and over birds, the winds, and

<p class='c009'>The origin of Solomon’s magical signet-ring, which is so often
mentioned in Oriental poetry and romance, according to Muslim
legends—borrowed or adapted from the Talmudic writers—is as
follows: Eight angels appeared to Solomon in a vision, saying
that Allah had sent them to surrender to him the power over
them and the eight winds at their command. The most exalted
of the angels presented him with a jewel with this inscription:
<em>To Allah belong greatness and might</em>. Whenever he raised the
stone towards heaven, they would appear and do his bidding.
Next four others appeared, differing from each other in form
and name. One resembled an immense whale, another an
eagle, the third a lion, and the fourth a serpent. These were
lords of all creatures living in the earth and in the water. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>angel representing the kingdom of birds gave him a jewel
on which was inscribed: <em>All created things praise the Lord</em>.
An angel then appeared, whose upper part looked like the
earth, and the lower like water, having power over both earth
and sea, and gave him a jewel with the inscription: <em>Heaven and
Earth are servants of Allah</em>. A third angel surrendered to him
power over the kingdom of spirits, with a jewel on which was
inscribed: <em>There is no God but one, and Muhammad is His
Messenger</em>.<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c014'><sup>[72]</sup></a> Solomon caused the four jewels to be set in a
signet-ring, and the first purpose to which he applied its
wondrous powers was the subjugation of the demons and jinn—all
but the mighty Sakhr, who was concealed in an unknown
island of the ocean, and Iblīs (Satan), the monster of all evil
spirits, to whom God had promised the most perfect independence
till the Day of Judgment.<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c014'><sup>[73]</sup></a> In Oriental fictions the most
solemn and binding oath with Fairies is to swear by the Seal of
Solomon. Readers familiar with the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> will
recollect the Story of the Fisherman and the Genie (<em>jinnī</em>). A
confidence in the virtue of Talismans, whether for the protection
of persons, treasures, or cities, may be traced up to the earliest
ages, when so many Eastern nations were of the Sabean faith,
and adored the “host of heaven,” or the celestial bodies;
and notwithstanding the change of religion and the prohibition
of magic, even Muhammadans can reconcile to their consciences
the preparation of certain amulets, after rules transmitted
through the Chaldeans and Nabatheans.<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c014'><sup>[74]</sup></a> The magic of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>Babylon is frequently alluded to by Muslim writers; the poets
speak of the “Babylonian witchery” of a beautiful woman’s
eyes; and it is believed that the two wicked angels Harūt and
Marūt, mentioned in the Kur’ān (see chap. ii, and Sale’s <em>note</em>),
are still hanging, head downwards, in a well at Babel, and will
instruct any one in magic who is bold enough to go and solicit
them. Setting idle legends aside, it is highly probable, as Sir
William Ouseley remarks, in his <cite>Persian Miscellanies</cite>, that at
Babylon the Persians learnt the arts of magical incantation from
the conquered Chaldeans. “Time,” says Dr Jonathan Scott,
“has not eradicated in Asia belief in the magical powers of
cabalistical characters engraven on gems, or embroidered on
standards, or written upon small rolls of paper, which, enclosed
in small boxes of gold and silver, and strung on silken cord, are
worn round the arm or wrist, and sometimes as a pendant from
the neck.”<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c014'><sup>[75]</sup></a> The charms to which the greatest efficacy is
ascribed are those consisting of passages of the Kur’ān; and
Morier tells that such was Muhammad Riza Bey’s faith in this
species of talisman that he always wore the whole of the Kur’ān
about his person; half of it tied on one arm, and half on the
other, rolled up in small silver cases.<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c014'><sup>[76]</sup></a> Next in estimation as
potent charms are passages transcribed from the celebrated
<cite>Burda</cite> (or Mantle-Poem) of El-Busīrī, in praise of the Prophet,
written in the 13th century; which are framed and suspended
on the walls of rooms, or, in cases, on the person. The whole
poem is also recited in times of sickness and during the funeral
procession.<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c014'><sup>[77]</sup></a></p>

to visit the tomb of a relation, and place on it the leaves or
broken branches of the palm-tree, also sweet-basil and other
flowers. On arriving at the tomb the opening chapter of the
Kur’ān, and sometimes a longer chapter, the xxxvi, is recited.—See

such as the law has not provided, but may be inflicted.—The

and its leaf, liberality, and its fruit, a degree of kindness, and
the leaf of every tree, of which the root becomes dry, assumes a
yellow [tint], and does not produce fruit. And as the root of
government is legal punishment, delay on this point is not
permissible; and as in this legal punishment there is postponement,
I am apprehensive lest the root of the tree has become
dry; after which reparation is impossible.”</p>

her a name suitable and proper;” alluding to the privilege
accorded to a mother of naming her own daughter; the name

children are not only taught to read the whole, but commit to

first chapter<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c014'><sup>[78]</sup></a>—which is to the Muslim what the Lord’s Prayer
is to the Christian—the remaining chapters are learnt in their
inverse order, and those who have learnt to repeat the whole of
the Kur’ān may then claim the title of <em>Hāfiz</em>, or <em>Hāfizu
kalāmi ’llāh</em>, “rememberer of the Word of God,” or “one
who knows God’s Word by heart.”—“Much merit,” says
Torrens, “is attributed by the Muslims to recitations of the
Kur’ān. On occasions of festivity persons are hired to repeat
either the whole or the principal parts of it. These are <em>fickees</em>, a
term usually applied to schoolmasters by modern Arabs, but
signifying, ‘a person learned in the law.’ They know by
heart the whole, or particular parts, of the Kur’ān, which each
in turn recites. These recitations are introduced among the
Egyptians as an entertainment at parties.”<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c014'><sup>[79]</sup></a></p>

writing,” says Sir John Malcolm, “is considered
as a high accomplishment. It is carefully taught in schools, and
those who excel in it are almost classed with literary men. They
are employed to transcribe copies of books, and some have
attained such an eminence in this art that a few lines written by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>one of these celebrated penmen are often sold for a considerable
sum. I have known seven pounds to have been given for four
lines written by Dervish Musjīd, a famous Persian scribe.”<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c014'><sup>[80]</sup></a>
And a story is told of a celebrated Indian penman, in the course
of his walks one day, being solicited for alms by a beggar,
“Money,” he replied, “I have not;” but taking his pen and
ink from his girdle, he wrote a few words on a small slip of
paper, and handed it to the poor man, who received it with
expressions of gratitude, and sold it to the first wealthy person
he met for a gold mohur—about ten shillings.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_88'>88</a>.</em> “And other accomplishments”: <em>adab</em>, that is,
“good manners;” a decent and becoming behaviour at meals,
a proper degree of respect to be shown to the father, greeting
him affectionately in the morning by kissing his hand, and—as
a well-bred son seldom sits in his father’s presence—standing
before him in a submissive attitude (<em>Lane</em>). Reverence for
parents, which is still a marked characteristic of Eastern races,
has ever been strongly inculcated by the Hebrew Rabbins; and
the noble conduct of one Dama, the son of Nethuna, towards
both his father and mother is adduced in the Talmud as an
example for all times and every condition of life. “His mother
was unfortunately insane, and would frequently not only abuse
him, but strike him, in the presence of his companions; yet
would this dutiful son not suffer an ill word to escape his lips,
and all he used to say on such occasions was, ‘Enough, dear
mother, enough.’ One of the precious stones attached to the
High Priest’s sacerdotal garments was once, by some means or
other, lost. Learning that the son of Nethuna had one like it,
the priests went to him, and offered him a very large price for it.
He consented to take the sum offered, and went into the
adjoining room to fetch the jewel. On entering the room he
found his father asleep, his foot resting on the chest wherein the
gem was deposited. Without disturbing his father, he went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>back to the priests, and told them that he must for the present
forego the large profit he might make, as his father was asleep.
The case being urgent, and the priests, thinking that he only
said so to obtain a larger price, offered him more money. ‘No,’
said he, ‘I would not, even for a moment, disturb my father’s
rest for all the treasures in the world.’ The priests waited till
the father awoke, when Dama brought them the jewel. They
then presented to him the sum they had last offered, but the
good man refused to take it. ‘I will not,’ said he, ‘barter for
gold the satisfaction of having done my duty. Give me what
you offered at first, and I shall be satisfied.’ This they did, and
left him with a blessing.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_91'>91</a>.</em> “I accept it as a favourable omen.”—Muslims are
always on the watch for lucky or unlucky omens. On first
going out of a morning, the looks and countenances of those
who cross their path are scrutinised, and a frown or a smile is
deemed favourable or the reverse. To encounter a person blind
of the left eye, or with one eye, forebodes sorrow and calamity.
While Sir John Malcolm was in Persia, as British Ambassador,
he was told the following amusing story: When `Abbās the
Great was hunting, he met, one morning as the day dawned an
uncommonly ugly man, at the sight of whom his horse started.
Being nearly dismounted, and deeming it a bad omen, he called
out in a rage to have his head struck off. The poor peasant,
whom they had seized and were on the point of executing,
prayed that he might be informed of his crime. “Your crime,”
said the King, “is your unlucky countenance, which is the
first object I saw this morning, and which has nearly caused me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>to fall from my horse.” “Alas!” said the man, “by this
reckoning, what term must I apply to your Majesty’s countenance,
which was the first object my eyes met this morning, and
which is to cause my death?” The King smiled at the wit of
the reply, ordered the man to be released, and gave him a
present instead of taking off his head.<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c014'><sup>[81]</sup></a> Another Persian story
to the same purpose: A man said to his servant, “If you see
two crows together early in the morning, apprise me of it, that I
may also behold them, as it will be a good omen, whereby I
shall pass the whole day pleasantly.”<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c014'><sup>[82]</sup></a> The servant did happen
to see two crows sitting in one place, and informed his master;
but when he came he saw only one, the other having in the
meantime flown away. He was very angry, and began to
beat the servant, when a friend sent him a present of choice
viands. Upon this the servant exclaimed: “O my lord, you
saw only one crow, and have received a fine present: had you
seen <em>two</em>, you would have met with my fare.”<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c014'><sup>[83]</sup></a> The old pagan
Arabs never set out upon any important expedition before consulting
their fortune, either by divining arrows or by the flight
of birds; if a bird flew to the right, it was a good omen, but if
to the left, they would postpone their intended enterprise. In
allusion to this superstition the celebrated poet Bahā ’u-’d Dīn
Zuhayr, of Egypt, says:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span><em>Page <a href='#Page_92'>92</a>.</em> “Purchased a young boy at the slave-market.”—Repellent
as even the name of slavery is to a European, and
especially to a Briton, it must not be supposed that the condition of
slaves in Muhammadan countries bears any resemblance to that
of the slaves in the Southern States of North America, before
their emancipation, with which such works as <cite>Uncle Tom’s
Cabin</cite> used to harrow up our souls. On the contrary, Muslims
are enjoined by their religion to be, and, as a general rule,
really are (all things considered), kind and even indulgent to their
slaves. Sir John Malcolm (an excellent authority) remarks:
“Slaves are not numerous [in Persia], and cannot be distinguished
by any peculiar habits or usages from the other
classes, further than that they are generally more trusted and
more favoured by their superiors. The name of slave in this
country may be said to imply confidence on one part and
attachment on the other. They are mostly Georgians or
Africans; and being obtained or purchased when young, they
are usually brought up in the Muhammadan religion. Their
master, who takes the merit of their conversion, appropriates
the females to his own harem, or to the service of his wives; and
when the males are at a proper age, he marries them to female
slaves in the family, or to free women. Their children are
brought up in the house, and have a rank only below relations.
In almost every family of consequence the person in whom the
greatest trust is reposed is a house-born slave; and instances of
their betraying their charge, or abusing the confidence that is
placed in them, are very rare.”<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c014'><sup>[84]</sup></a> A curious story is related in
the Talmud, of a man making his will in favour of his slave,
although he had a son whom he loved fondly. This man, residing
at some distance from Jerusalem, had sent his son to the
Holy City to “complete his education” (to employ an absurd
colloquial phrase for the nonce); and dying during his son’s
absence, he bequeathed his entire estate to one of his slaves, on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>the condition that he should allow his son to select any one
article which pleased him for an inheritance. Surprised and
naturally angry at such gross injustice on the part of his father,
in preferring a slave for his heir instead of himself, the young
man sought counsel of his preceptor, who, after carefully considering
the terms of the will, thus explained its meaning and
effect: “By this action thy father has simply secured thy
inheritance to thee. To prevent his slaves from plundering the
estate before thou couldst formally claim it, he left it to one of
them, who, believing himself to be the owner, would take good
care of the property. Now, what a slave possesses belongs to
his master; choose, therefore, the slave for thy portion, and then
possess all that was thy father’s.” The young man followed
this advice, took possession of the slave, and thus of his father’s
wealth, and then gave the slave his freedom, together with a
considerable sum of money.<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c014'><sup>[85]</sup></a>—“The manners of Asia,” says
Richardson, “seem in all ages to have pointed to domestic
slavery; and Muhammad, in Arabia, made that an article of
religion which had anciently been only a custom. The captives
of war were, in consequence, with few exceptions, constantly
reduced to a state of servitude; and little distinction seems in
general to have been made between a princess and her slave;
excepting what she derived from a superiority of personal
accomplishments. These ideas the Arabians entertained amidst
their extensive conquests. Many instances might be given, but
two will suffice, as they were daughters of the two greatest
princes in the world. In an action after the siege of Damascus,
in <span class='fss'><abbr title='Anno Dominem'>A.D.</abbr></span> 635, amongst other prisoners was the daughter of
Heraclius, emperor of Greece, and widow of the governor of
that city. Rasi, the Arabian commander, to whose lot she fell,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>presented her without ceremony as a slave to Jonas, a Grecian,
who had embraced the Muhammadan religion; but Jonas, from
a principle of honour, returned her, with all her jewels, unransomed
to her father. When the Arabians conquered Persia,
Shīrīn Bānū, the daughter of the King Yazdejird, was one
of the captives, and was publicly exposed to sale in the city of
Madīna; but the liberal-minded `Alī thought differently from
his countrymen on this occasion; he declared that the offspring
of princes ought not to be sold, and married her immediately to
his son.”<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c014'><sup>[86]</sup></a>—The lot of women in Arabia before the time of
Muhammad was at the best a hard one, and it certainly underwent
no improvement when they happened to be taken captive
in any of the frequent tribal wars. (The brutal treatment of the
beauteous Abla, in the <cite>Romance of `Antar</cite>, when she fell into
the hands of the chief of a tribe hostile to that of `Abs, is doubtless
a faithful picture of Arabian life in those times.) And
there can be no question that the cruel and unnatural practice
which prevailed among the pre-Islamite Arabs of burying alive
their new-born female children had its origin in a desire to save
them from the hardships they were so likely to encounter when
grown up. This practice seems to have been at one time
common to most of the nations of antiquity.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_93'>93</a>.</em> “Several of the soldiers returned.”—They probably
came to report to the King that the enemy were in

gray horse.”</p>

clemency, and in this respect the ukase of Alexander II, on the

complete amnesty to all the political offenders of 1825–6, and of
the Polish rebellion of 1831, who were still in exile, or <em>in prison</em>;
also pardons to Press offenders, military defaulters, and to about
five thousand other individuals in gaols.”</p>

<h3 class='c023'><span class='sc'>Notes on Chapter IX.</span></h3>

<p class='c021'><em>Page <a href='#Page_97'>97</a>.</em> “The history of Abū Temām, and the envy of the
envious.”—The Muslim, in his daily prayers, says: “I fly for
refuge unto the Lord of the Daybreak; that He may deliver me
from the mischief of the envious, when he envieth.”—Kur`an
cxiii. 5.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span><em>Page <a href='#Page_97'>97</a>.</em> Abū Temām.—Abū—literally, “Father”—has
often the sense of “endowed with,” or “possessed of,” and
forms the figure called “metonymy.” Thus, Abū Bakr, “father
of the maid”—Muhammad’s father-in-law and successor; Abū
Hurayrat, “father of the kitten,” one of Muhammad’s companions,
so nicknamed by the Prophet, on account of his having
a pet cat.—Abū Temām signifies, “possessed of integrity.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_98'>98</a>.</em> “Any one possessed of above five direms”—equivalent
to “any one who had a sixpence.”—It is related of Mūlī
Isma`īl, Emperor of Morocco (who died in 1714), that when any
of his subjects grew rich, in order to keep him from being
dangerous to the state, he used to send for his goods and
chattels. His governors of towns and provinces formed themselves
on the example of their dread monarch, practised rapine,
violence, extortion, and all the art of despotic government, that
they might the better send him their yearly presents: for the
greatest of his viceroys was in danger of being recalled or hanged
if he did not remit the bulk of his plunder to his sovereign.
That he might make a right use of these treasures, he took care
to bury them under ground, by the hands of his most trusty
slaves, and then cut their throats, as the most effectual method of
securing secrecy. The following story will illustrate his notions
of property: Being upon the road, amidst his life-guards, a little
before the Ram feast, he met one of his kāzīs at the head of his
servants, who were driving a great flock of sheep to market.
The Emperor asked whose they were. The kāzī, with a profound
submission, answered: “They are mine, O Isma`īl, son of
El-Sherīf.” “Thine! thou wretch!” exclaimed Mūlī Isma`īl;
“I thought I had been the only proprietor in this country.”
Upon which he ran him through the body with his lance, and
piously distributed the sheep among his guards for the celebration
of the feast. His determination of justice between man and
man will evince the blessings of his administration: A kāzī
complaining to him of a wife (whom he had received from his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>Majesty’s hands, and therefore could not divorce her), that she
used to pull him by the beard, the Emperor ordered his beard
to be plucked out by the roots, that he might not be liable to
any more such affronts. A farmer, having accused some of his
guards of having robbed him of a drove of oxen, the Emperor
shot the offenders; but afterwards demanding reparation of the
accuser for the loss of so many brave fellows, and finding him
insolent, he compounded the matter with him by taking away
his life.—One good thing he was celebrated for in the course of
his long reign, the clearing of the roads of robbers, with which
they used to be infested; but his method was to flay man,
woman, and child that lived within a certain distance of the
district where a robbery was committed.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_99'>99</a>.</em> “The erection of bridges, caravanserais, and
mosques.”—It is doubtful whether “caravanserais” be the
correct rendering of the word <em>ribāt</em>. It may denote one of the
dome-shaped buildings (<em>kubba</em>), having an oratory annexed,
and an institution endowed for the maintenance of students
(<em>tālibān-i-`ilm</em>), who are to pass their lives in reading and
devotion.—Sa`dī, in his <cite>Bustān</cite>, b. i, says: “No one hath
come into the world for continuance, save him who leaveth
behind him a good name; nor hath any one died who hath left
as an inheritance a bridge, a mosque, a hostel, or an hospital.
Whoever hath left no such memorial behind him, his existence
has been but that of a tree which never bore fruit; and whoever
hath departed and left no mark, his name after his death will
never be lauded.” The “erection of mosques” may remind
the reader of a passage in <cite>Hamlet</cite>, iii, 2: “There’s hope a
great man’s memory may outlive his life half a year; but, by’r
Lady, <em>he must build churches then</em>.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_99'>99</a>.</em> “His advice was followed in all matters of importance.”—The

(or Transoxiana), is the country which lies beyond the Jihūn, or
Oxus. Under the names of Irān and Turān the Eastern historians
comprehend all the higher Asia, excepting India and
China; and sometimes they imply “the whole world.” The
Tātār nations in general have fine countenances, with large
black eyes. Of all the towns in Turkistān, Chighil is the
most famous for handsome men, expert archers, and beautiful
maidens:</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_101'>101</a>.</em> “When the King of Turkistān heard of Abū
Temām’s arrival, he sent proper officers to receive and compliment
him.”—See third note, p. <a href='#Page_131'>131</a>.—In Lescallier’s version
the interview between the King and Abū Temām is related in
more detail, to the following effect:</p>

<p class='c009'>Abū Temām, after presenting his credentials and paying his
respects to the King, informed him of the subject of his embassy.
“The request which the King your master makes for my
daughter,” said the King of Turkistān, “is for me a source of
joy and happiness. But as it is to be feared that my daughter is
unworthy of the King your master, I desire you to enter my
harem to see her and to hear her speak, and to assure yourself if
she is capable of pleasing the sovereign who sends you. I will
prepare my daughter to receive you.” Abū Temām, who was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>full of cleverness and discretion, replied to the King with the
greatest politeness: “God forbid, your Majesty, that my eyes
should behold the Princess, or my ears should dare to hear her
voice! If she were not in all respects worthy of the King my
master, the Divine will would not have inspired him with the
desire of possessing her, nor enslaved his heart to her perfections.
My King did not send me with such instructions.”
Abū Temām had no sooner spoken these words than the King
of Turkistān clasped him in his arms with affection, and
cried: “I regard thee as a father, for thou freest my existence
from a great burthen.” “O great King!” replied Abū
Temām, “since my happy star made me enter the service
of my sovereign, I have never experienced anything save
benefits, kindness, and peculiar favours. What is the difficulty
that I can solve for your Majesty? Let him command me.”
“I was even now,” said the King, “busy with the project of
thy death, and thou hast happily escaped the severity of my
sharp sword. I shall tell thee the motive which urged me to
put thee to death, and how thou hast been delivered from that
danger. All the ambassadors who have come from different
princes to ask my daughter have received the same proposal
which I made to thee, to enter my harem, to judge of the beauty
and perfections of the Princess; and they all went in. I
regarded the prudence and wisdom of these sovereigns according
to those of their ambassadors, and to punish their audacity I
put them all to death. This year four hundred ambassadors
have been beheaded. I preserve their heads in the room which
thou wilt see.” Then the King drew from his girdle a key,
with which he opened the door of that room, and showed to
Abū Temām the four hundred heads of ambassadors. He
afterwards added: “The prudence which thou hast shown has
saved thy life. It has given me a good opinion of thy sovereign,
and I will grant him my daughter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lescallier’s texts were probably in error in stating that the
four hundred ambassadors had all been put to death within a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>year. The lithographed text, like that of Sir William Ouseley,
gives us to understand that the envoys had been beheaded in the
course of years. In Habicht’s Arabian text the King is represented
as saying: “‘Come and look into this well;’ and
Abū Temām beheld a well filled with the heads of the sons of
Adam.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_103'>103</a>.</em> “The Ten Viziers finding&nbsp;... their own
importance and dignity reduced,” &amp;c.—How true to human
nature, and how applicable to the case of Abū Temām as well as
to that of our young hero Bakhtyār, is the “saying of the sage,”
as cited in the <cite>Anvār-i Suhailī</cite> (ii, 3): “Whoever is unceasingly
zealous in the service of the King quickly reaches the
rank of admission to his favour, and whoever has become the
intimate of the Sultan, all the friends and foes of the monarch
become his enemies: the friends, through envy of his post and
dignity; and the foes, by reason of his advising the King sincerely
in matters of state and religion.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_103'>103</a>.</em> “Whose office was to rub the King’s feet.”—The
Arabs (says Lane) are very fond of having their feet, and especially
the soles, slowly rubbed with the hand; and this operation,
which is one of the services commonly required of a wife or
a female slave, is a usual mode of waking a person; as it is also
of lulling a person to sleep. Thus, in the story of Maaroof
(Lane’s <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>, iii, 721), “the damsel then proceeded
to rub and press gently the soles of his feet until sleep overcame
him.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_105'>105</a>.</em> “The King drew his scimitar, and cut off his
head.”—Surely, an instance of “haste and precipitancy”—with
a <em>vengeance</em>! This despot did not even acquaint his victim of
the crime of which the lads had accused him. It had been
probably otherwise with Abū Temām had his royal master
shaped his conduct in “affairs of moment” after that of another
king, of whom we read, in the <cite>Anvār-i Suhailī</cite> (xiii, 3), that
in order to moderate his anger, and judge cases like a king, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>recluse gave him three letters, which he was to place in the
hands of a faithful and confidential officer, who was to be permitted
to read one of them to the King when he beheld symptoms
of anger in his countenance, and should that not suffice to
soothe his mind, the officer was to read the second letter, and
the third, if the second did not tame his rebellious spirit. The
contents of the three letters were to this effect: (1) While thou
still retainest the power, do not place the reins of choice in the
grasp of thy passions, for they will plunge thee into the whirlpool
of everlasting destruction. (2) In the time of wrath be
merciful to those in thy power, in order that in the hour of
retribution thy superiors may be merciful to thee. (3) In issuing
thy commands do not overstep the bounds of the law, and under
no circumstances abandon what is just.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_106'>106</a>.</em> “Their houses levelled with the ground.”—When
a city was solemnly destroyed by the Romans, the plough was
drawn along where the walls had stood. Thus Horace (Ode i,
16): “Rage has been the final cause&nbsp;... that an insolent
army has driven the hostile ploughshare over their walls.” Thus
also we read in the sacred writings (Micah iii, 12): “Therefore
shall Zion for your sake be ploughed as a field;” and likewise of
salt being sown on the ground where cities stood (see Judges ix,
45), indicating the last insult of a triumphant enemy. In allusion
to the usual practice of absolute Eastern monarchs wreaking
their vengeance not only on an offending minister, but also on
his wife and family, Sa`dī, in his <cite>Bustān</cite>, b. i, directs a king,
in dealing with a criminal, to slay him, if the law pronounce its
decree; “but if thou hast those who belong to his family, them
forgive, and extend to them thy mercy: the iniquitous man it
was who committed the crime;—what was the offence of his
helpless wife and children?”</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c009'>In Cazotte’s rendering of this story, under the corrupted title
of Abou Talmant, for a King of Turkistān is substituted a King
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>of Cochin-China. The plot for destroying the prudent minister by
means of the prattle of two young slaves in the King’s hearing is
considerably amplified: the malicious viziers having taught them
to repeat some harem gossip while the King was reposing, but
not asleep, which, proving to be true, prepared him to believe
the false story of the Queen’s love for Abū Temām. The King’s
discovery of his favourite’s innocence is differently related;—instead
of his overhearing the two pages quarrel over the division
of the money, a day or two after Abū Temām had been put to
death, as in the Persian version—the King immediately returns
to his private chamber, and seeing the pieces of gold scattered on
the floor, sends for the pages, and compels them to tell the
truth regarding their possession of so much money. He then
causes the <em>two</em> Viziers to be beheaded.</p>

<em>`Ajam</em> includes all who cannot speak Arabic, or who do not
speak it with elegance. Among the Arabs it applies to all
people not of Arab descent, and carries the same idea as Barbarians
with the Greeks, Gentiles with the Hebrews. Hence
Persia is called `Ajamistān, the land of the stranger, or barbarian.
And so two famous Arabian poems are distinguished
respectively by the nationalities of their authors: <em>Lāmiyyatu-’l-`Arab</em>,
by the Arabian brigand-poet Shanfará, and <em>Lāmiyyātu-’l-`Ajam</em>,

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_108'>108</a>.</em> “Not having any child,” &amp;c.—The desire of
offspring, and especially of male children, seems to have always
been very strong among Asiatics of all classes, and by Jews the
want of children was considered sufficient ground for divorce, as
the following beautiful rabbinical story will show: A man,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>it is related, brought his wife before Rabbi Simon, expressing
his desire to be divorced, since he had been married over ten
years without being blessed with children. The Rabbi at first
endeavoured to dissuade the man from his purpose, but finding
him resolute, he gravely addressed the pair thus: “My children,
when you were married did ye not make a feast and entertain
your friends? Well, since you are determined to be divorced,
do likewise: go home, make a feast, entertain your friends, and
on the following day come to me and I will comply with your
wishes.” They returned home, and, in accordance with the
good Rabbi’s advice, the husband caused a splendid feast to be
prepared, to which were invited their friends and relations. In
the course of the entertainment, the husband, being gladdened
with wine, said to his wife: “My beloved, we have lived many
happy years together; it is only the want of children that makes
me wish for a separation. To convince thee, however, that I
still love thee, I give thee leave to take with thee out of my
house whatever thou likest best.” “Be it so,” answered his
wife. The wine-cup was freely plied by the guests, and all
became merry, until at length many had fallen asleep, and
amongst these was the master of the house, which his wife perceiving,
she caused him to be carried to her father’s house and
put to bed. Having slept off the effects of his carouse, he
awoke, and, finding himself in a strange house, exclaimed:
“Where am I?—how came I here?” His wife, who had
placed herself behind a curtain to await the issue of her little
stratagem, came up to him, and told him that he had no cause
for alarm, since he was in her father’s house. “In thy father’s
house!” echoed the astonished husband—“how should I
come hither?” “I will soon explain, my dear husband.
Didst thou not tell me last night that I might take out of thy
house whatever I most valued? Now, my beloved, believe me,
amongst all thy treasures there is none I value so much as I do
thyself.” The sequel may be readily imagined: overcome by
such devotion, the husband affectionately embraced his wife, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>reconciled to her, and they lived happily together ever afterwards.<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c014'><sup>[88]</sup></a>—Throughout
the East, indeed, the want of children is
considered as a great disgrace. Readers of Oriental romances,
such as those contained in <cite>Elf Layla wa Layla</cite>, or The Thousand
and One Nights; <cite>Bahār-i Dānish</cite>, or the Spring of
Knowledge, and <cite>Kissa-i Chehār Darvīsh</cite>, or Tale of the Four
Dervishes, will easily call to mind the many stories of Khalīfs,
Sultāns, Shāhs, Viziers, &amp;c. being childless, and of the pious
and even magical means they adopted to obtain the blessing of
a son and heir.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_108'>108</a>.</em> “In a dream.”—Muslims consider dreams as the
predictions of future events. Good dreams are believed to
be from God, and false ones from the Devil. “Whoever seeth
me,” said the Prophet, “<em>in his sleep</em>, seeth me truly; for
Satan cannot assume the similitude of my form.”—Lane’s <cite>Thousand
and One Nights</cite>, iii, p. 512, <em>note</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_108'>108</a>.</em> “Was addressed by an old man,” &amp;c.—According

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_109'>109</a>.</em> “The top of a mountain, from which he shall
fall, rolling in blood and clay.”—Lescallier’s rendering goes on
to say: “He shall yet escape the murderous teeth of that lion;
and when he has attained his twentieth year, he shall give you a
wound, and put you to death.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_109'>109</a>.</em> “One of his Viziers eminently skilled in astrology”—Lescallier
adds, “assisted by many other astronomers.”—In
Eastern courts an astronomer would be held in disrespect if he
did not debase the truth of his science to the vain predictions of
astrology (<em>‘ilmu-’n-nujūn</em>). Every professional astrologer
hangs an astrolabe—which is not larger than the hollow of the
hand—in a neat case, at his girdle. Some have an astrolabe
two or three inches in diameter, which at a distance looks like a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>medal conferred on the wearer as a mark of honour, or as an
order of merit.<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c014'><sup>[89]</sup></a> “A very slight knowledge of astronomy,” says
Sir John Malcolm, “is sufficient to allow a Persian student to
profess the occult science of judicial astrology. If a person
can take an altitude with an astrolabe, knows the names of the
planets and their different mansions, and a few technical
phrases, and understands the astrological almanacs that are
annually published, he deems himself entitled to offer his services
to all who wish to consult him; and that includes every
person in Persia who has the means to reward his skill. Nothing
is done by a man of any consequence or property without
reference to the stars. If any measure is to be adopted, if a
voyage or journey is to be commenced, if a new dress is to be
put on—the lucky or unlucky moment must be discovered, and
the almanac and astrologer are consulted. A person wishing
to commence a journey will not allow a fortunate day to
escape, even though he is not ready to set out. He leaves his
own house at the propitious moment, and remains, till he can
actually proceed, in some incommodious lodging in its vicinity,
satisfied that, by quitting his house, he has secured all the
benefit which the influence of good stars can afford him.”<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c014'><sup>[90]</sup></a> When
Sir John Malcolm entered Tehrān as British Ambassador, the
King’s astrologer so timed the progress of the cavalcade that the
“Elchī’s” charger should put his foot over the threshold of the
gate at the precise lucky moment, which he had previously ascertained.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Chaldeans were the first astrologers, and the so-called
science was sedulously cultivated and in high estimation among
the Hindūs, the Greeks, the Egyptians, and their Alexandrian
disciples. Even the illustrious Tycho Brahe was devoted to
astrology from his early youth until within a few years of his
death, when he finally abandoned it as a fallacy. At first, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>for a very long period afterwards, astrology was not separated
into the two divisions or departments of <em>natural</em> astrology, or
observations of the regular motions of the heavenly bodies (which
is now termed <em>astronomy</em>), and <em>judicial</em> astrology, or the pretended
science of foretelling events from observation of the
relative positions of the planets. Isidore of Seville, it is said,
was the first to distinguish between astronomy and astrology.
The professors of judicial astrology in Europe pretended—as
those in Asiatic countries still pretend—to be able to predict
the destiny of any one who came to consult them, by a process
called <em>casting his horoscope</em>, which was done by first ascertaining
the precise hour of the person’s birth, and the sign the sun was
in at that time, and then drawing conclusions from observation
of the conjunction and relative position of the planets towards
each other. But European astrologers very frequently—probably
as a general rule—did not trouble themselves to “read
the stars;” they were for the most part accomplished physiognomists,
and it may be said that they usually contented themselves
with telling fortunes by faces rather than by the appearance
of the heavenly bodies. There can be little doubt that, with the
exception of a few deluded individuals who thoroughly believed
in their own skill, those who professed a knowledge of astrology
were arrant impostors—cunning knaves, who traded on the
prevalent superstition and credulity of mankind in the days
before science began to shed its pure light.</p>

<p class='c009'>El-Hajjāj, a general under the Khalīf El-Walīd I, consulted,
in his last illness, an astrologer, who predicted to him
his approaching death. “I rely so completely on your knowledge,”
said El-Hajjāj to him, “that I wish to have you with
me in the next world, and I shall therefore send you thither
before me, in order that I may be able to employ your services
from the time of my arrival.” He then ordered the soothsayer
to be put to death, although the time fixed for this event by the
planets had not yet arrived.—Abū-’l-Ma`shar, the oracle of
astrology, left in writing, that he found the Christian religion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>according to the indications of the stars, should last but fourteen
hundred years—he has been belied by nearly five hundred years
already.—Tiberius, when he was at Rhodes, wished to satisfy
his curiosity with respect to judicial astrology. He sent, in succession,
for all those who pretended to foretell future events.
One of his enfranchised slaves, of great stature and extraordinary
strength, conducted them to him through the intricacies of
the precipices. If Tiberius discovered that the astrologer was a
cheat, the slave, upon a given signal, immediately cast him into
the sea. At that time there was at Rhodes a man named
Trasullus, who was deeply skilled in astrology, and of a cunning
disposition. He was taken, in the same manner as the others,
to this retired spot, assured Tiberius that he should be Emperor,
and revealed to him many other events that should take place.
Tiberius asked him if he knew his own destiny, and if he had
consulted his own horoscope. Trasullus—who had had some
suspicions when he did not see any of his companions return,
and felt his fears increase on viewing the countenance of
Tiberius, the man who had been his conductor (who did not
quit him for a moment), the elevated place where he stood, and
the precipice which lay beneath him—turned his eyes up to
heaven, as if to consult the stars; he immediately appeared fear-stricken,
turned pale, and exclaimed, in an apparent agony of
terror, that he was menaced with death. Tiberius was full of
joy and admiration on hearing this reply, ascribing to astrology
what was only presence of mind and cunning, cheered the spirits
of Trasullus, embraced him, and from that time regarded him
as an oracle.—An astrologer foretold the death of a lady whom
Louis XI passionately loved. She did, in fact, die, and the
King imagined that the prediction of the astrologer was the
cause of it. He sent for the man, intending to have him
thrown out of the window as a punishment. “Tell me,” said
the King, “thou who pretendest to be so clever and learned a
man, what thy own fate will be?” The soothsayer, who suspected
the intentions of the King, and knew his foible, replied:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>“Sire, I foresee that I shall die three days before your Majesty.”
Louis believed him, and was careful of the astrologer’s life.—An
astrologer, fixing his eyes upon the Duke of Milan, said to him:
“My Lord, arrange your affairs, for you have not long to live.”
The Duke asked: “How dost thou know this?” “By my
acquaintance with the stars,” answered the astrologer. “And
pray, how long art thou to live?” “My planet promises me a
long life.” “Well, thou shalt shortly discover that we ought
not to trust the stars.” And the Duke ordered him to be
hanged instantly.—Our own King Henry VIII asked an
astrologer if he knew where he should pass the festivities at
Christmas. The astrologer answered that he knew nothing on
the subject. “Then,” said the King, “<em>I</em> am wiser than <em>thou</em>
art; for I know that thou shalt pass them in the Tower of
London;” and the unlucky astrologer was at once conducted
thither.—William, Duke of Mantua, had in his stables a brood
mare which gave birth to a mule. He immediately sent to the
most famous astrologers in Italy the hour of the birth of this
animal, requesting them to inform him what should be the
fortune of a bastard that had been born in his palace; he took
care, however, not to intimate that he was speaking of a mule.
The soothsayers used their best endeavours to flatter the Prince,
not doubting that the bastard belonged to himself. Some declared
that it should be a general; others made it a bishop;
some raised it to the rank of cardinal; and there were even
some who elevated it to the papal chair!</p>

<p class='c009'>It is truly marvellous that the same age which produced a
Newton should also have seen flourish that arch-astrologer
William Lilly (inimitably satirised by Butler under the name of
Sidrophel),<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c014'><sup>[91]</sup></a> whose preposterous predictions were credited even
by persons of education.  Swift may be said to have dealt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>the death-blow to astrology by his celebrated squib, entitled
“Prediction for the year 1718, by Isaac Bickerstaff, Esq.,” in
which he ridiculed the prophetic almanac-makers of the day.
Astrology having permeated all science and literature, it is not
surprising that many of its peculiar terms should have become
embodied in our language, as, for example, in the words <em>consider</em>
and <em>contemplate</em>, <em>disaster</em> and <em>disastrous</em>; and we still
speak of <em>jovial</em>, <em>mercurial</em>, and <em>saturnine</em> men.—Kepler, in the
preface to his Rudolphine tables, observes that Astrology,
though a fool, was the daughter of a wise mother, to whose
support and life the foolish daughter was indispensable.<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c014'><sup>[92]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_109'>109</a>.</em> “In the meantime he caused a subterraneous
dwelling to be constructed, to which he sent the boy, with a
nurse.”—Sir William Ouseley has omitted to mention that the
boy <em>was</em> born—on the following day, according to Lescallier.—Many
instances of a father trying to belie the predictions of
soothsayers occur in Eastern fiction, and also in classical and
European legends. The story of Danae, the daughter of
Acrisius, King of Argos, by Eurydice, who was confined in a
brazen tower by her father, who had been told by an oracle that
his daughter’s son should put him to death, is well known. The
underground dwelling of our present tale may be compared with
that described in chapter 79 of the English <cite>Gesta Romanorum</cite>;
also that in the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> (Story of the Second Kalender);
and in the <cite>Bāgh o Bahār</cite> (Tale of the Second Dervish), a
young prince, in consequence of the prediction of astrologers
that he is menaced with great danger until his fourteenth
year, is confined in a vault, lined with felt, so that he should
not behold the sun or moon. In Mr Ralston’s <cite>Tibetan Tales</cite>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>under the title of “The Fulfilled Prophecy,” the diviners
declare that “a son should be born who should take the King’s
life and usurp the royal power, setting the diadem on his own
head.” In the Norse story of “Rich Peter the Pedlar,”<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c014'><sup>[93]</sup></a> a
prediction that his daughter should one day wed a poor man’s
son is fulfilled in spite of many efforts to defeat it—a story
which seems to have been adapted from the <cite>Gesta Romanorum</cite>,
Tale xx of Swan’s translation. And in the Netherlandish
Legend of “St Julian the Ferryman,” it is predicted that
Julian shall one day put his own father and mother to death;
and although the unhappy youth flies into a far distant country,
he cannot flee from his terrible destiny, for many years afterwards
the prediction proves only too true.<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c014'><sup>[94]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_114'>114</a>.</em> “Assembled all the people by proclamation”—that
they might take warning from the young man’s fate. But
the Persians require no invitation to scenes of this nature. “The
curiosity,” says Dr Chodzko,<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c014'><sup>[95]</sup></a> “which gathers crowds of
people to witness the execution of culprits in Europe is very feeble
in comparison with what can be seen in Asia on similar occasions.
There many of those present are not only fond of looking at, but
even take an active part in tormenting the condemned, though
they never saw him before, or have any motive of revenge. To
stab the poor dying wretch with a knife, or at least to spit in his
face, is an innocent pleasure, which even the women do not
refuse themselves. Those who are moved by revenge are still
more savage. Riza Kūlī Khān, the governor of Yezd, having
expelled from that town one of the sons of the Shāh (in 1830),
was afterwards taken prisoner and sent to Tehrān. The Shāh
gave the culprit up to the offended prince, who, after promising
to pardon and forget all, invited him to supper in the harem, and
there stabbed him with his own hands. His wives, and the
maid-servants of the harem, <em>cut to pieces</em> the body, weltering in
blood, with scissors, and pricked and tortured him till he gave
up his last breath!—I can see no reason for this but their
brutalising education. A child begins by wringing off the heads
of living sparrows. When he grows up they buy him a little
sword, and exercise the boy in cutting in two halves, first living
fowls, then lambs, sheep, and so on. Grown-up people consider
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>it as a very fashionable pastime to snatch a ram from the flock,
order two of their servants to hold it by the head and feet, and
placing a bundle of straw underneath, in order to prevent the
sword from striking against the ground, to cut the bleating
animal to pieces while it is alive. The most famous of such
swordsmen in Persia was Sulaymān Mīrza, son of Fatah `Alī
Shāh. He has often, in the presence of the Shāh and numerous
witnesses, with one blow of his huge scimitar cut in two an ass,
and severed the head of a camel from its neck.”</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c009'>In Lescallier’s version, for the King of Persia we have the
King of Arabia.—In Cazotte’s rendering, under the title of
“The Sultan Hebraim [Ibrahīm] and his Son, or The Predestined,”
is found a considerably amplified but very interesting
version of this story. After the young prince has
been discovered and carried away from the underground
palace by a huntsman (not the King’s secretary, but “a
man of rank and fortune”), the incidents are totally different
from those of our version. Abaquir—the young prince—is
carefully brought up by his master, and in course of time
becomes accomplished in all the exercises befitting a noble
youth. One day he accompanies his master to the chase, when
they are suddenly attacked by robbers, who slay the elder of the
hunters, and having severely wounded Abaquir, leave him for
dead. Recovering after a long period of insensibility, he rises
and walks onwards through the forest, till he meets with a
dervish, who takes him to his cave and treats him with kindness
and hospitality. This dervish proves to be a wicked magician,
who prevails upon Abaquir to descend into the bowels of a
mountain to bring up precious stones, which the false dervish
having drawn safely up, the poor youth is then cruelly abandoned
to his fate. From this cavern Abaquir escapes, and after
a long journey he reaches a city, where a kind-hearted man
receives him into his house, and he remains with him some time.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>Weary at length of inaction, he resolves to go out to hunt, and
meets with a party of robbers, whose real avocation he does not
know, and joins them—the robbers binding him to fidelity by a
solemn oath. Too late he discovers the true character of his
companions, but is compelled to accompany them on their
plundering expeditions. The daring outrages perpetrated by
this gang of robbers become so notorious that the Sultan
Hebraim marches against them at the head of some chosen
troops. The robbers are utterly defeated, but the Sultan himself
is grievously wounded. On returning to his capital he
sends for his astrologers, and angrily asks them whether in their
predictions they had foreseen that he should die by the hand of
a robber. They affirm that what the stars had predicted could
not prove false, and suggest that the Sultan should ascertain
who it was, among the robbers, that wounded him, and then
inquire into his birth and history. Abaquir, his own son, is
the robber who inflicted the fatal wound; and after he
has given the best account he could of his early years, and
shown the scars of the lion’s claws on his breast, the Sultan
submits to the decree of Fate, and dies shortly after declaring
Abaquir his successor.—In Habicht’s Arabian text (which agrees
with Cazotte in nearly all the details) it is stated that the King
went once every month to the opening of the underground
dwelling, let down a rope, and drew up his son, embraced and
kissed and played with him awhile, then let him down again.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Page <a href='#Page_93'>93</a>.</em> “The King graciously received the present which
Rūzbih offered.”—It is well known that, in all parts of the
East, whoever visits a great person must carry him a present.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>“It is counted uncivil,” says Maundrell, p. 26, “to visit in
this country without an offering in hand. All great men expect
it as a tribute due to their character and authority; and look
upon themselves as affronted, and indeed defrauded, when the
compliment is omitted.” In the sacred writings we find mention
made of this custom. For instance, 1 Samuel ix, 7: “But
behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is
spent in our vessels, and there is not a present (<em>teshurah</em>) to
bring to the man of God—what have we?” Menachem explains
<em>teshurah</em> to signify “an offering or gift, which is presented
in order to be admitted into the presence of a King or
some great man.” See also Isaiah lvii, 9, <em>lit.</em>: “And thou hast
visited the King with a present of oil.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The King of Yemen and his Slave”—see page <a href='#Page_56'>56</a>, and last
note, page <a href='#Page_174'>174</a>.—This story in Habicht’s Arabian text is entitled
“The History of King Bihkard,” and the following passages
may be compared with those of our text and with Lescallier,
above referred to: On a certain day he went on a hunting
excursion, and one of his servants shot an arrow, and it struck
the King’s ear, and cut it off. The King asked: “Who shot
this arrow?” The attendants instantly conducted the bowman
to the front, and his name was Yatrū. Fainting from fear, he
threw himself on the ground, and the King said: “Put him to
death.” But Yatrū said: “O King, this fault is not of my own
choice or knowledge—pardon me, then, out of thy kindness,
since grace is the most gracious of actions, and oftentimes on
some future day becomes a treasure and a benefit, and in the
sight of God a recompense at the last day. Pardon me, then:
as you avert evil from me, so will God ward off from thee a
similar evil.” When the King heard these words, he admired
and forgave Yatrū, yet never had he before pardoned any one.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now this servant was of royal extraction, and had fled from
his country, by reason of some transgression, and had entered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>the service of King Bihkard. And this is what happened to
him. By chance a person who knew him passed that way, and
gave information to his father, who sent him a letter, which
gratified his heart and disposition; and he returned to his
father, who inclined indulgently towards him. Yatrū rejoiced,
and his affairs were rectified.—Compare also Lescallier and
Cazotte, cited in pp. <a href='#Page_178'>178</a>, <a href='#Page_179'>179</a>.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>According to Habicht’s text, the account of Abū Temām’s
delicate—not to say dangerous—mission to the King of Turkistān
is very different from that of the Persian version. The King
desires him to enter the harem, and see and converse with the
Princess; and he proceeds thither, reflecting on the way that
“Wise men have averred that whoever deprives his sight [that
is, closes his eyes] no evil can attach to him; and whoever
bridles his tongue hears nothing disagreeable; and whoever
restrains his hand, it can neither be shortened nor lengthened.”
He accordingly enters the chamber of the Princess, and sits down
on the floor, gathering together the extremities of his robe.
When the King’s daughter requests him to raise his head,
look upon and converse with her, Abū Temām remains mute,
and with downcast eyes. She then requests him to take
the pearls, and the gold and silver which lie near him, but he
does not extend his hand towards anything. At this the
Princess is vexed, and tells her father that they have sent a
blind, and deaf, and foolish ambassador; whereupon the King
of Turkistān demands of Abū Temām why he had not looked
upon and conversed with his daughter: he replies that he had
seen everything [he should see]; and in answer to the inquiry,
why he had not taken the proffered pearls, he says that it was
not proper for him to extend his hand to aught that belongs to
another. The King, overjoyed at his prudence, embraces him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>shows him the heads of former ambassadors (see page <a href='#Page_214'>214</a>, line
4), consents to give his daughter in marriage to Abū Temām’s
royal master, and presents him with a robe of honour, after which
Abū Temām departs, and in due course the Princess is sent to
the palace of Īlan Shāh.</p>

<h3 class='c023'><em>Arabian Version of the Conclusion of the Romance.</em></h3>

<p class='c021'>In Habicht’s Arabian text the conclusion is as follows (comp.
pp. <a href='#Page_115'>115</a>–117):</p>

<p class='c009'>When the youth had finished his narrative, the King said:
“Still thou wouldest bewilder us with thy discourses, but the
time is now come for your execution.”—At the moment when
they were conducting the youth to the gallows, the robber-chief
who had educated him arrived in the town. When he observed
the people assembling together, he inquired the cause, and they
said to him: “The King has commanded a young culprit to be
executed.” The robber-chief, who wished to see the youth,
immediately recognised him, and kissed him on the mouth, and
said: “This youth, when a child, I found near a fountain. I
adopted him, and brought him up. One day we attacked a
caravan, and were driven into flight, and he was taken prisoner.
Since then I have sought everywhere for him, and never could
gain any news respecting him.” When the King heard this he
cried aloud, threw himself on the youth, embraced and kissed
him, and said: “I should have put my own son to death, and
in consequence should have died of grief.” The King then
unfettered the Prince, took the crown from his own head, and
placed it on that of his son. The news was made public by the
beating of drums and the braying of trumpets, the town was
illuminated, and there arose such a shouting of joy that the birds
could scarcely support themselves in the air. All prisoners were
released by order of the King, and a seven days’ festival proclaimed
throughout the kingdom.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the eighth day the King placed his son at his side, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>summoned all his friends, the city notables, and the viziers. To
these last the Prince said: “You see now the work of God’s
providence—you now perceive His aid was near.” The Viziers
were struck dumb, and the King added: “I observe that on this
day all the people rejoice, even the birds of the air—ye only are
downcast; that is truly a proof of rancour against me. Had I
listened to your advice, I should have died from the effects of
despair and repentance.” The King then summoned to his
presence the robber-chief, made him many presents, and said:
“Whoever loves the King, let him lavish gifts on this man.”
Whereupon he was so overwhelmed with presents that he could
not take any more; and the King then conferred upon him the
governorship of the province in which he had dwelt.</p>

<p class='c009'>Soon afterwards the King ordered nine sets of gallows to be
erected near the one already set up, and said to his son: “Thou
wast guiltless—these wicked Viziers slandered thee in my eyes.”
The Prince rejoined: “My crime consisted of my loyalty to
thee—seeing that I removed their hands from thy treasures,
they envied me, and wished my death.” “On that account,”
said the King, “let their punishment now be near, for their
crime is great: to destroy thee, they did not scruple to disgrace
my house in the opinion of all sovereigns.” He then turned to
the Viziers, and said to them: “Woe be to you! Wherewith
can you excuse yourselves?” They replied: “O King, there is
no excuse for us—we were unkind to the youth, and wished his
misfortune, which has recoiled on us;—for him we dug a grave
and have fallen into it ourselves.” Hereupon the King issued an
order for their execution—“for,” said he, “God is just, and all
His judgments are true.” The King afterwards lived in happiness
and peacefully with his spouse and his son, until the
disturber of all earthly friends reached them likewise.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. Perhaps one of the most curious instances of the migrations
of popular tales is the following. In Taylor’s <cite>Wit and Mirth</cite>,
an excellent jest-book, compiled by the celebrated Water-Poet
(<em>temp.</em> James I of England), we are told of a countryman who
had come up to London on a visit, and some wags having set
a big dog at him in sport, the poor fellow stooped to pick up a
stone to throw at the brute, but finding them all rammed hard
and fast into the ground, he exclaimed in astonishment: “What
strange folk are these, who fasten the stones and let loose their
dogs!” More than three centuries before Taylor heard this
jest, the Persian poet Sa`dī related it in his <cite>Gulistān</cite>, or Rose-Garden
(ch. iv, story 10 of Eastwick’s translation): “A poet
went to the chief of a band of robbers, and recited a panegyric
upon him. He commanded them to strip off his clothes, and
turn him out of the village. The dogs, too, attacked him in
the rear. He wanted to take up a stone, but the ground was
frozen. Unable to do anything, he said: ‘What a villanous
set are these, who have untied their dogs, and tied up the
stones!’”—Here we have a jest, at the recital of which, in the
14th century, “grave and otiose” Easterns wagged their
beards and shook their portly sides, finding its way, three
centuries later, to London taverns, where Taylor probably
heard it told amidst the clinking of cans and fragrant clouds
blown from pipes of Trinidado! But how came it thither?—that
is the question.</p>

the most complete account which we possess of the manners,

with which his residence in that country, and familiarity with the

<p class='c009'><a href='#r6'>6</a>. For example: before one story (1) is ended another (2) is
begun, and before it is finished another (3), springing out of the
second, is commenced; then out of story 3 springs yet another
story (4), which ended, number 3 is resumed and brought to an
end, then number 2, after which number 1 is resumed and concluded;
and then the thread of the <em>leading</em> story—which runs
throughout the whole work, like a brook through a meadow, but
often out of sight—is taken up once more;—to lead presently
to a fresh complication of stories, which “beget one another to
the end of the chapter!” The arrangement of the Tales in the

with the various meanings attached to the word <em>Ghulām</em>; which
in the Malay romance seems to be employed as a proper name:
“Gulām (not Ghulām), an Arabic word, signifies ‘a boy,’ ‘a
lad.’ The Persians have made it, in their language, signify
‘a slave,’ and thence ‘a life-guardsman,’ and ‘a king’s messenger;’
whence ‘any post-messenger who travels on horse-back’—or by
rail, now, in some places: all these really mean ‘a lad.’ The

to me, as follows, on this question: “First, be it observed, the
only titles of Kings mentioned in the Persian text are, Shāh,
Pādishāh, Malik, and Kaisar; nowhere do we find the sovereign
title of Sultān, but it occurs in Habicht’s Arabic text. This
title was first borne by Mahmood ibn Sabuktakeer, <span class='fss'><abbr title='Anno Dominem'>A.D.</abbr></span> 1002
(<span class='fss'><abbr title='Anno Hegirae'>A.H.</abbr></span> 393), and did not exist in Egypt until <span class='fss'><abbr title='Anno Dominem'>A.D.</abbr></span> 1171 (<span class='fss'><abbr title='Anno Hegirae'>A.H.</abbr></span>
567). At page <a href='#Page_184'>184</a> of your Notes and Illustrations reference is

<span class='fss'><abbr title='Anno Dominem'>A.D.</abbr></span> 1257 (<span class='fss'><abbr title='Anno Hegirae'>A.H.</abbr></span> 655), and it is as well to bear in mind that the
poet was born <span class='fss'><abbr title='Anno Hegirae'>A.H.</abbr></span> 1175 (<span class='fss'><abbr title='Anno Hegirae'>A.H.</abbr></span> 571), and by some said to have
attained the advanced age of 102, by others 116 years. The
work, therefore, is more likely to have been written towards
the close of, rather than after, the 13th century. Next may be
considered the arms of defence and offence, which required the
appointment of an armour-bearer (see page <a href='#Page_111'>111</a>, line 6), viz.,
bow, quiver—containing broad-bladed arrows—sword, or
scimitar, mace, or bludgeon, shield, and a spear, or lance; all of
which were employed by the Crusaders. Now the first of the
eight crusades dates <span class='fss'><abbr title='Anno Dominem'>A.D.</abbr></span> 1096 (<span class='fss'><abbr title='Anno Hegirae'>A.H.</abbr></span> 490), and the last <span class='fss'><abbr title='Anno Dominem'>A.D.</abbr></span>
1270 (<span class='fss'><abbr title='Anno Hegirae'>A.H.</abbr></span> 669). These considerations are connected with the
Seljukian kingdom of Rūm, of which the capital was Koniah
(Iconium), founded <span class='fss'><abbr title='Anno Dominem'>A.D.</abbr></span> 1074 (<span class='fss'><abbr title='Anno Hegirae'>A.H.</abbr></span> 467), and lasted until
<span class='fss'><abbr title='Anno Dominem'>A.D.</abbr></span> 1307 (<span class='fss'><abbr title='Anno Hegirae'>A.H.</abbr></span> 707); in all, 233 years. Much confusion
arises from the Ruler of the Eastern Empire being called Kaisar-ī
Rūm, a title also assumed by the Seljukian dynasty. The
Kaisar-i Rūm of Chapter III may allude to any occupant of
the Constantinopolitan throne between the years <span class='fss'><abbr title='Anno Dominem'>A.D.</abbr></span> 1257 and

<p class='c009'><a href='#r21'>21</a>. In this entertaining book a Parrot is represented as relating
stories night after night, in order to prevent a merchant’s wife
from carrying on a criminal intrigue during her husband’s
absence. Nakshabī’s work has not yet been wholly translated
into English—see <em>foot</em> note, page <a href='#Page_197'>197</a>. Of Kāderī’s abridgment
(which is very clumsily done) a translation, together with his Persian
text, was published at Calcutta, and reprinted at London
in 1801. Kāderī has certainly done Nakshabī’s literary reputation
no small injury, by the manner in which he has cut down the
stories, and by substituting his own inexpressive and bald style
for the graceful composition of the original. It is to be hoped
that ere long some competent scholar will present English readers
with a fair translation of Nakshabī’s excellent work, which
would prove of considerable service to those interested in tracing
the migrations and transformations of popular tales.—Besides the
<cite>Suka Saptati</cite>, above mentioned, there is another Indian book, in
Tamul, on the same plan, entitled <cite>Hamsa Vinsati</cite>, Twenty
Tales of a Hamsa, or Goose, told with the same object as that
of the Parrot—to keep an amorous lady at home until her husband

<p class='c009'><a href='#r52'>52</a>. The King was wont to visit the well where Abū Saber lay, and to jeer

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f53'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r53'>53</a>. That is, the story of Abraha, obscurely referred to in the opening paragraph,
page <a href='#Page_56'>56</a>. Abraha, we are there informed, “was the son of the King
of Zangībār, who, <em>by chance</em>, had fallen into slavery, and never disclosed the
secret to any one.” Lescallier says, that he was reduced to slavery “by
some extraordinary adventure,” but the text does not explain the nature of
the “adventure.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f54'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r54'>54</a>. Khōja: in its more restricted meaning, a lord, a master; Muhammad
is styled <em>Khōja-i bas o nashr</em>, literally, “lord of the raising and dispersing,”
that is, the Resurrection. In its general signification, a man of distinction,
doctor, professor, &amp;c. But the title of Khōja, like our “Mr” is now very
commonly applied to any respectable person.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f55'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r55'>55</a>. “Zangistān.”—The Oriental adjunct <em>stān</em> or <em>istān</em>, the participle of
<em>istādan</em>, “to reside,” or “dwell,” denotes “place,” or “country,” whence
Moghol-istān, a port of Tartary; Fars-istān, Persia; Khūz-istān, Susiana.
The root of <em>stān</em> may be seen in our English word “station.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f56'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r56'>56</a>. “Four parasangs.”—A Persian league, about 18,000 feet in length, is
<em>Fars-sang</em>, that is, the Stone of Persia, which Herodotus and other Greek
authors term <em>Parasanga</em>. It seems that in ancient times the distance of a
league was marked in the East, as well as in the West, by large elevated
stones.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f57'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r57'>57</a>. The love of Jacob for his son Joseph, and his grief at his supposed death,
are proverbial amongst Muslims, and very frequently alluded to by Persian
poets. In the 12th sura of the Kur’ān it is stated that Jacob became blind
through constant weeping for his lost son, and that his sight was restored by
means of Joseph’s inner garment, which the Governor of Egypt sent to his
father by his brethren. In the <cite>Makamat</cite> of El-Hariri, the celebrated
Arabian poet, are such allusions as “passed a night of sorrow like Jacob’s,”
“wept more than Jacob when he lost his son.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f58'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r58'>58</a>. Probably the messenger went to Yemen in the assumed capacity of a
merchant, which would render him least liable to suspicion, and also enable
him to smuggle Abraha out of the city without attracting particular notice.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f59'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r59'>59</a>. The same savage maxim occurs in the <cite>Anvār-i Suhailī</cite>: “When thou
hast got thy enemy fast, show him no mercy.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f60'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r60'>60</a>. Islām is not, as is commonly believed in Europe, synonymous with
Fatalism. “What Muhammad taught,” remarks Mr Redhouse, “what
the Kur’ān so eloquently and so persistently sets forth, and what real
faithful Muslims believe, conformably with what is contained in the Gospels
and accepted by devout Christians, is—that God’s Providence pre-ordains, as
His Omniscience foreknows, all events, and over-rules the designs of men, to
the sure fulfilment of His all-wise purposes.”—<cite>El-Esmā’u-’l-Husna</cite>, “The
Most Comely Names” [<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i> of God], by J. W. Redhouse, M.R.A.S.

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f61'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r61'>61</a>. There are many varieties of this amusing story in Europe as well as in
Asia—whether Father Beschi found it in India or took it with him.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f62'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r62'>62</a>. “The ‘Uygur’ language,” Mr J. W. Redhouse writes to me, “is
simply Turkish; what we should term ‘a little provincial.’ It is very much
more consistent with the Ottoman Turkish of to-day than the English of
four hundred years ago was like the modern English.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f63'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r63'>63</a>. Here, surely, the Tātār translator—or adapter—anticipates the course
of the narrative; since the King (unfortunately for the Vezīr Kārdār) did <em>not</em>
possess, at one and the same time, <em>two</em> Vezīrs and a beautiful wife—if by the
latter be meant the pious daughter of Kerdār.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f64'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r64'>64</a>. Kārdān signifies “knowing affairs”—“experienced.” The meaning of
Kerdār (as Kārdār is pronounced by Turks) is already given in the foregoing
notes.</p>
